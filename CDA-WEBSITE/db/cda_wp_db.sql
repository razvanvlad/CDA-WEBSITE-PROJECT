My general approach is to lean more on WordPress\'s REST API over time which is more reliable since it\'s maintained by the WordPress team, and only use WPGraphQL when it\'s necessary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also recommend turning off auto-updates and test your website extremely thoroughly after any upgrade.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n	<div class=\"review-head\">\n		<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n			<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n				<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great! 10 stars if possible</h4>\n				<div class=\"star-rating\">\n				<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span></div>				</div>\n			</div>\n			<p class=\"reviewer\">\n				By <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chisnghiax/\"><img alt=\'\' src=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/48a7f4f320763869961fad5d20a07b8996259921c3bb7fab4b5a2d4f6914e844?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g\' srcset=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/48a7f4f320763869961fad5d20a07b8996259921c3bb7fab4b5a2d4f6914e844?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x\' class=\'avatar avatar-16 photo\' height=\'16\' width=\'16\' loading=\'lazy\' decoding=\'async\'/></a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chisnghiax/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">chisnghiax</a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 7, 2022</span>			</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"review-body\">Great!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n	<div class=\"review-head\">\n		<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n			<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n				<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin!</h4>\n				<div class=\"star-rating\">\n				<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span></div>				</div>\n			</div>\n			<p class=\"reviewer\">\n				By <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/2cubed/\"><img alt=\'\' src=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76f1cb13f179e916222228b5452c294ab3d54740a875244305a8b09f3bcf6ea1?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g\' srcset=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/76f1cb13f179e916222228b5452c294ab3d54740a875244305a8b09f3bcf6ea1?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x\' class=\'avatar avatar-16 photo\' height=\'16\' width=\'16\' loading=\'lazy\' decoding=\'async\'/></a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/2cubed/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">2cubed</a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 26, 2022</span>			</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"review-body\">One of the best plugins for WordPress.

WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg joined a diverse lineup of speakers, panelists, and workshop leaders who brought fresh perspectives to the open web from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of Portland — with its iconic bridges, coffee culture, and creative energy — the Sponsor Hall buzzed as companies across the WordPress ecosystem demoed new products, shared insights, and connected with attendees. Each day offered opportunities to refuel with local flavors and international favorites, turning mealtimes into lively hubs of networking and idea-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Portland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US is the annual gathering point for the WordPress community — where collaboration, creativity, and innovation intersect. This year in Portland, the event delivered an expansive program that reached every corner of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> – Keynotes, presentations, and discussions explored the evolving web and the role of open source in shaping it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> – Voices from across continents brought local stories and global visions to the stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> – From AI in WordPress development to accessibility, design systems, content strategy, education, and case studies of WordPress at scale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> – Workshops provided practical takeaways, empowering attendees to apply new skills immediately.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> – Whether contributing code, exploring business strategies, or sharing creative projects, attendees found space to learn, grow, and celebrate open source together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors took their first steps into open source, seasoned developers explored cutting-edge AI integrations, and agencies and product teams shared strategies for scaling WordPress to meet modern needs. Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community. By day’s end, the collective energy was clear: WordPress continues to be built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Amy Sample Ward &quot;The Tech That Comes Next&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKnM75GFZxw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/LoS3iv3Gsow?feature=shared&amp;t=6287\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/gJdfiNNHjec?feature=shared&amp;t=934\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/gJdfiNNHjec?feature=shared&amp;t=21642\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US - Danny Sullivan &quot;How (and why!) Google Search Keeps Evolving&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZF_sxLdfTbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/Y1YRXkE1HLc?feature=shared&amp;t=5898\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/Y1YRXkE1HLc?feature=shared&amp;t=9495\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/SNWPTCUUAZs?feature=shared&amp;t=1011\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/SNWPTCUUAZs?feature=shared&amp;t=5808\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Ma.tt Mullenweg &quot;Keynote Address &amp; Q&amp;A&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/45HRzzc0waU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

While WordPress thrives on contributions from a global volunteer community, many students and newcomers face barriers to entry, such as a lack of structured guidance or real-world experience in open source projects. This new program is designed to bridge that gap, nurturing future contributors and ensuring WordPress remains innovative, inclusive, and sustainable for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gamma.app/docs/EN-WordPress-Credits-vz0k2vr1ulg91qq?mode=doc\">pilot program</a>, developed in partnership with the University of Pisa, was announced on stage at WordCamp Europe 2025 by Matt Mullenweg and Mary Hubbard. Since then, it has attracted interest from students across various fields of study, including humanities, computer science, and communication. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem have also expressed support and interest in contributing to the project. In response to the growing interest from both community members and academic institutions, we are now inviting more universities to join the initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open to students from all fields of study, the program blends structured onboarding with a personalized contribution project. Activities are adapted to each student’s degree program and familiarity with WordPress, aiming to develop transferable skills, academic-related competencies, and active participation in the WordPress community. Internship durations may vary depending on the university or educational institution. Some may align with academic semesters (typically 3–4 months), while others, like the University of Pisa, allow students to sign up year-round with a requirement to complete a set number of contribution hours (e.g. 150 hours). Flexible arrangements can be discussed to meet the specific requirements of each institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundational Training includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An introduction to open source principles and the WordPress Foundation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Getting familiar with community tools (Slack, Make blogs, Learn platform, GitHub)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Setting up a personal WordPress site and publishing content</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each student will choose a contribution area and design their own personal project within that area. Examples of possible projects include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Translating interfaces or documentation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating multilingual subtitles for educational videos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contributing code or performing testing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting product development or design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Writing or editing content</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assisting with community event organization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developing training materials for Learn WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating open source tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And much more…<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interns are guided by an experienced mentor specific to their chosen area and supported by a dedicated WordPress Foundation contact person throughout the program. All student contributions, whether code, translations, documentation, or educational materials, will be publicly visible and integrated into official WordPress projects and resources, directly benefiting the wider community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interested universities and educational institutions</strong> interested in participating can reach out by filling <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/shrYvY0CDNIkILIre\">the interest form</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also invite companies in the WordPress ecosystem to support this initiative by sponsoring mentors who will guide and empower the next generation of contributors, or by providing tools and resources that help students succeed in their contribution journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If your company is interested in getting involved</strong>, please visit the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/get-involved-company-guide/\">Company Guide</a> to learn more and <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appIzQKfwTn5dyPVp/shrKDkjeUdw8Fof34\">fill out the form</a> to join the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By welcoming students, mentors, sponsors, and volunteers into this initiative, we are building a stronger and more connected WordPress community.

It was followed by two days of engaging talks, panels, hands-on workshops, and vibrant community connections. WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg and Executive Director Mary Hubbard joined a diverse lineup of speakers and panelists, sharing insights in the heart of one of Europe’s most charming cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the backdrop of Basel’s historic streets and Rhine-side views, the sponsor hall buzzed with activity as companies from across the WordPress ecosystem showcased their latest innovations, offered live demos, and connected with attendees. Each day, participants refueled with a range of local and international cuisine — from Swiss specialties to global favorites — making mealtime a lively space for networking, collaboration, and sparking new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Basel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe has long been one of the most anticipated WordPress events of the year — a space where community, creativity, and collaboration thrive.

Guided by 33 dedicated table leads, with 21 teams, attendees of all experience levels came together to exchange ideas, solve real challenges, and make meaningful contributions to open source.

range of teams, from Core and Accessibility to Polyglots, Training, and Community. Attendees tackled everything from onboarding and ticket triage to translating strings, improving documentation, and enhancing tools and workflows. Development-focused teams explored performance and testing improvements and worked through live coding exercises. Meanwhile, accessibility testers, support volunteers, and photo moderators contributed to efforts that directly impact users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, teams like Marketing, Meta, Hosting, and Sustainability focused on future-facing initiatives—from promoting WordPress through the Showcase and social media campaigns to refining infrastructure, increasing accessibility, and preparing for long-term project growth. Whether contributing to plugins, themes, documentation, or new contributor experiences, participants reinforced the values that power the WordPress project: collaboration, inclusivity, and openness. The day served as a reminder that WordPress is not just software—it’s a community built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tomorrow Starts with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of WordCamp Europe 2025 brought the community together to celebrate the power of open source collaboration and innovation. Opening remarks from both global and local event leads reflected on the journey of WordCamp Europe—from its beginnings in 2013 in Leiden, Netherlands, to the vibrant event in Basel today. This full-circle moment underscored the growth of the WordPress community, united by a shared commitment to an open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day launched into an inspiring program with the keynote session, <em>WordPress Without Borders – The Fight for Digital Freedom</em>, delivered by Noel Tock. Drawing from his experiences—including time on the frontlines in Ukraine—Tock illustrated how open source supports global resilience and serves as a digital human right. His message called on contributors to see their work as part of something greater, offering a compelling and forward-looking vision to energize and unify the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordPress without Borders — The Fight for Digital Freedom | Noel Tock\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb_A-ABehnY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the program unfolded across multiple tracks—each one sparking new conversations and insights. One standout session highlighted social entrepreneurship in Bulgaria, where WordPress is helping grassroots organizations drive change in education, journalism, and social justice. Petya Raykovska shared how nonprofits like Teenovator and the Bulgarian Fund for Women are using WordPress to amplify their work and strengthen their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers and developers explored ways to improve workflows and collaboration. In <em>Bridging Design and Development</em>, attendees learned how Figma Design Systems can connect design and development through shared structures mapped to block themes. Real-world examples, like the Novus Media Newspaper Design System, demonstrated how scalable, consistent design can power multi-brand platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshops played a key role throughout the day, including the interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook: WCEU 2025 Edition</em>, where attendees worked through community-voted code recipes featuring the latest WordPress APIs. Sessions also dove into emerging technologies, such as <em>Automating WordPress Setup with Modern AI Tools</em>, which showcased how WP-CLI, scripting, and AI can accelerate project setup and reduce repetitive tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18817\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Photo by Marc Wieland</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Day Two of WordCamp Europe 2025 opened with a focus on the evolving role of the WordPress community in a rapidly changing digital world. Sessions explored how contributors—from local meetup organizers to global advocates—play a vital part in shaping WordPress’s future. Talks on inclusivity, such as <em>Over the Rainbow</em>, encouraged attendees to consider how individual actions can help build a more welcoming, representative open source ecosystem. Throughout the morning, the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose remained front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the day progressed, attention turned to the tools and technologies pushing WordPress forward. From sessions on scaling multilingual sites and managing observability to hands-on workshops, developers explored new ways to streamline workflows and enhance performance. Highlights included <em>WordPress Gems for Devs</em>, which introduced the Interactivity API through live coding, and <em>Client-side Web AI Agents</em>, a look at cutting-edge browser-based AI that unlocks new possibilities for web experiences. These talks reflected the platform’s growing capacity to adapt to emerging trends while staying true to its open foundations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The afternoon brought a blend of practical guidance and inspiring stories across tracks. A case study on accessibility from Switzerland showed how thoughtful design can benefit all users, while a session on brand-building for women entrepreneurs highlighted the creative and economic opportunities WordPress enables. With topics spanning content strategy, business growth, regulatory readiness, and more, the second day of WCEU 2025 affirmed the strength of the WordPress ecosystem—not only as a technology platform, but as a global movement fueled by people, purpose, and possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fireside Chat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the final day drew to a close, Matt and Mary shared some thoughts on EU regulation (Open Web Alliance), AI, and the introduction of the WordPress AI team, and then answered questions from the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fireside chat with Q&amp;A | Mary Hubbard and Matt Mullenweg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzJwYejWUbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to the dedicated organizers who brought WordCamp Europe 2025 to life in Basel, the speakers who shared their insights, the attendees who joined us in person, and those who followed along from afar. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

This team provides a central place to collaborate, share ideas, and build together.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid iteration</strong>: Like the Performance Team, we’ll take a plugin-first approach. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/\">Canonical Plugins</a> will allow us to move quickly, gather feedback, and deliver real value without waiting on the Core release cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI Team will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coordinate cross-team efforts to explore AI-powered features responsibly and inclusively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publish and maintain a public roadmap of AI initiatives and Canonical Plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collaborate closely with Core, Design, Accessibility, and other teams to ensure strong integration and shared standards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress AI Team brings deep experience in open-source, performance, and product development and a strong commitment to building AI features the WordPress way. The team will launch with the following team contributors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>James LePage</strong> – Automattic</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Felix Arntz</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pascal Birchler</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jeff Paul</strong> – 10up</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help get things started, James and Felix will serve as the initial <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/\">Team Reps</a> in supporting team organization, communication, and coordination with other Make WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an exciting and important step in WordPress’s evolution.

I&#8217;ll ask everyone to share their name and how long they have been involved in open source. We&#8217;ll do this <a href=\"https://www.facilitator.school/glossary/popcorn-style\">popcorn style</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I&#8217;ll quickly review some norms for this club:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Make Space </strong>for each other — Be conscious of how much you are speaking and encourage others to speak as well. While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/opinion/interrupting-cooperative-overlapping.html?searchResultPosition=1\">cooperative overlapping</a> is a conversation style that is natural to some, it&#8217;s one we should avoid in this context. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Approach this club with <strong>enthusiastic collaboration </strong>— This is a phrase that I stole from the preface and is one of the ways that the author describes the unique culture of open source. In this context the phrase means to me that everyone is coming with a positive attitude and a desire to share and learn. We will all assume good intent since everyone is approaching this with good intent. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Camera On by default</strong>, no questions asked if camera is off — It&#8217;s easier and more engaging if we can see each other, so I want to encourage you to have your camera on, but there are also a multitude of reasons that you may want it off. You don&#8217;t need to explain why your camera is off, but if you can, please turn it on. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After that we will get to the meat of the session, and discuss these two sections. I&#8217;ll bring a few questions to help get the discussion flowing, but I would also love if folks brought their own as well. Since the majority of participants don&#8217;t work in open source day in and day out, I expect some questions to be about ways to apply our learnings outside open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I am going to encourage everyone to spend some time blogging their thoughts after the discussion. This can be a reaction to something you read or something discussed. It can be notes you took while reading, but I would like to encourage blogging. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/wp-book-club-week-1/\">WP Book Club Week 1</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in\">Aaron Jorbin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:51:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Summer WordPress Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=149189\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://ma.tt/2025/08/wcus-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1497:\"<p>I&#8217;m still buzzing from an incredible WordCamp US this week, from contributor day to the closing party the vibes were right and it was amazing to connect with fellow travelers in the journey towards creating a more free and open source internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before our open town hall Q&amp;A I was able to make some fun announcements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Traffic to WordPress.org is up, and we&#8217;ve brought the plugin queue from months to basically a few days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previewed Block Comments and the upcoming Command Palette feature in 6.9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shared some fun AI experiments, including <a href=\"https://github.com/felixarntz/wp-ai-sdk-chatbot-demo\">Felix&#8217;s AI chatbot demo</a>, <a href=\"https://telex.automattic.ai/\">Automattic&#8217;s new Telex block creator</a>, and more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Got to announce details for the next two flagships:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>WordCamp Asia 2026</strong>: Mumbai, India, from April 9<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>WordCamp US 2026</strong>: Phoenix, Arizona, from August 16<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup>. <img alt=\"😅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f605.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Give it a watch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Aug 2025 03:25:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WordPress.org blog: Portland Welcomes WordCamp US 2025: A Community Gathering\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=19074\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/08/portland-welcomes-wcus-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33930:\"<p>A full house of attendees gathered in Portland, Oregon, for WordCamp US 2025, with thousands more tuning in online.

Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community. By day’s end, the collective energy was clear: WordPress continues to be built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

experience in the room made this year especially notable. First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/LoS3iv3Gsow?feature=shared&amp;t=6287\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/gJdfiNNHjec?feature=shared&amp;t=934\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/gJdfiNNHjec?feature=shared&amp;t=21642\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/Y1YRXkE1HLc?feature=shared&amp;t=5898\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/Y1YRXkE1HLc?feature=shared&amp;t=9495\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/SNWPTCUUAZs?feature=shared&amp;t=1011\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/SNWPTCUUAZs?feature=shared&amp;t=5808\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

In the 90s I was running around the Vallley trying to explain to everyone that blogging was going to change everything, all I got was blank stares from people who said &#8220;we don&#8217;t do that.&#8221; They of course eventually did do it.

Next</a></li></ol></nav>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-lab\">Performance Lab</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/#committers\">core committer</a> for <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/14/a-decade-as-a-core-committer-my-wordpress-contribution-history/\">over 10 years</a>, and since Spring 2023 I&#8217;ve been heavily involved on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>. In addition to contributing patches directly to the WordPress core codebase, we also develop new performance optimizations in the form of feature plugins. We use our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin as a way to collect the feature plugins we&#8217;re currently working on to facilitate discovery:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these performance feature plugins are developed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/performance\">WordPress/performance</a> monorepo on GitHub. In the same way as the Gutenberg plugin serves as a way to develop new editor features, the Performance Lab plugin is a way we incubate new performance features. It allows us to get feedback from users and test the impact prior to being proposed for merging into a new release of WordPress core when it gets rolled out to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">~43%</a> of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-study-twenty-twenty-five\">Case Study: Twenty Twenty-Five</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The default theme for the current version of WordPress is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfive/\">Twenty Twenty- Five</a>. Default themes in core basically encapsulate the latest and greatest in what WordPress has to offer in terms of features and performance. Indeed, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/\">block themes</a> are generally faster than classic themes (especially with page caching) for a few reasons, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Scripts and styles are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/01/block-styles-loading-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/\">selectively loaded</a> based on whether their blocks actually used on the page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blocks are more likely to use the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/\">Interactivity API</a> which involves deferred <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/script-modules-in-6-5/\">script modules</a> (which don&#8217;t block rendering) and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Twenty Twenty-Five theme should be very fast, and indeed it is. But with Performance Lab features (and beyond), it can be made even faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mileage will vary with other themes, either having an even greater impact or a lesser one. Every site is unique (hopefully!) and so the impact of optimizations depends on a page&#8217;s contents, how a theme is built, and which plugins are active. But in this post, I&#8217;ll show the impact of the optimizations in various page layouts of the Twenty Twenty-Five Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-testing-methodology\">Performance Testing Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most popular way to analyze the performance of a webpage is to use <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\">Lighthouse</a>, either <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview#devtools\">in Chrome DevTools</a> or via the bottom half of <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Lighthouse allows you to test pages either as a desktop or mobile device, <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#why-is-the-performance-score-so-low-it-looks-fine-to-me\">emulating</a> the viewport, CPU, and connection speed. Lighthouse is an important tool to get a sense of a page&#8217;s performance, but it has limitations. It captures data from a single page load on a simulated device. There is often <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse?tab=readme-ov-file#why-does-the-performance-score-change-so-much\">variability</a> in the results, and it also doesn&#8217;t reflect the experience of real users which is what you&#8217;d get from Real User Monitoring (RUM), such as in the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\">Chrome User Experience Report</a> (CrUX)—shown in the first section of PageSpeed Insights. Lighthouse provides simulated <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#lab_data\">lab data</a> whereas CrUX provides real <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#field_data\">field data</a>, which is more accurate. Nevertheless, field data can take a long time to collect and it can be difficult to do A/B tests at scale to capture the before/after performance impacts. That said, CrUX is definitely used to track the performance of new WordPress releases overall, as <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/\">Felix Arntz</a> shared the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/19/wordpress-performance-impact-on-core-web-vitals-in-2023/\">WordPress performance impact on Core Web Vitals in 2023</a>. Felix also wrote up how to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/04/05/conducting-wordpress-performance-research-in-the-field/\">conduct WordPress performance research in the field</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of measuring the impact of performance optimizations here, lab data will be more practical because the results are available in real time, without having to wait for real users to provide field data. And I&#8217;m interested in relative performance impacts, not necessarily absolute ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a Lighthouse audit before and after a Performance Lab feature plugin is active is a way to measure the impact of the optimization. However, given variability in the results, it can be difficult to be certain of the improvement. A Lighthouse audit may no longer flag an area for improvement, but the overall Lighthouse score may be unchanged. Indeed, even a Lighthouse score of 100 doesn&#8217;t mean the page performance is “perfect”.

LCP metric is <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">weighted</a> at 25% of the total Lighthouse score. As noted in how <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">how Lighthouse scores are determined</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The metric value for LCP represents the time duration between the user initiating the page load and the page rendering its primary content. Based on real website data, top-performing sites render LCP in about 1,220ms, so that metric value is mapped to a score of 99.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A 1.2 second LCP is 12 times slower than a 100 ms LCP, where 100 ms is a <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/#:~:text=0.1%20second%20is%20about%20the%20limit%20for%20having%20the%20user%20feel%20that%20the%20system%20is%20reacting%20instantaneously%2C%20meaning%20that%20no%20special%20feedback%20is%20necessary%20except%20to%20display%20the%20result.\">proposed</a> threshold for the user to perceive a reaction as being instantaneous. Nevertheless, a “good” LCP value is 2.5 seconds and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).

The longer it takes the server to respond with the generated HTML document, the more this will hurt the LCP metric. A slow TTFB means you are less likely to have a good LCP. If a site has a 1.5-second TTFB which needs improvement, then this leaves only 1 second for the LCP element to be rendered to get a good LCP metric. A good TTFB is considered to be about half that, at 800 ms and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"TTFB (Time To First Byte).

This means it is all too likely that a 1.5-second TTFB is the norm for WordPress sites. This is in part what contributes to WordPress lagging behind most other CMSes for the LCP metric <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/k9MqdchHqw4\">on mobile</a> and <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/j4AmmUaraQM\">on desktop</a>, even about 10% below the average on all measured sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison with the other CWV metrics—<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/cls\">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (CLS) and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\">Interaction to Next Paint</a> (INP)—WordPress is doing worse in terms of LCP, as evident in the metric passing rates from the following <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/landing\">reports</a> on HTTP Archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-right\">Device</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">LCP</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">CLS</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">INP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=mobile&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Mobile</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">53%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">83%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">86%</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=desktop&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Desktop</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">64%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">71%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">98%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, improving LCP remains the most important focus for performance optimizations in WordPress. So in this post I&#8217;ll focus on the LCP impact for the plugins featured in Performance Lab and some other changes proposed for WordPress 6.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benchmarking\">Benchmarking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Lighthouse score is variable and a 100 score merely reflects a “good” LCP, evaluating the performance benefit of an optimization requires measuring the LCP metric itself. Due to the variability in the metric, it&#8217;s important to obtain the median value of the LCP over many measurements. By capturing the median LCP value before and after an optimization is applied, the relative impact on performance can be measured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool I use for benchmarking LCP is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research\">GoogleChromeLabs/​wpp-research</a> repo, which my team developed when I was at Google. Specifically, I use the <code><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/tree/main/cli#benchmark-web-vitals\">benchmark-web-vitals</a></code> command which includes the ability to emulate mobile and desktop devices, network connections, and CPU speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example command I use to benchmark two URLs emulating a mobile device on a Fast 4G connection, and compare their results:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=none\"</span> \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=foo\"</span> \\\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Helper mu-plugin to override active plugins via query vars\n<p>I threw this together to help me with benchmarking so that I didn&#8217;t have to manually activate/deactivate plugins constantly.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Active Plugins Override\n */</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">namespace</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">ActivePluginsOverride</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">get_always_active_plugins</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">array</span> </span>{\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'user-switching/user-switching.php\'</span>\n	);\n}\n\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $plugins )</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_unique( array_merge( $plugins, get_always_active_plugins() ) );\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_all_plugins\'</span>] ) || ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] ) &amp;&amp; $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] === <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'none\'</span> ) ) {\n	add_filter( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'__return_empty_array\'</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( is_array( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n		$disable_plugins = $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>];\n	} <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\n		$disable_plugins = explode( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\',\'</span>, $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] );\n	}\n\n	add_filter(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n		<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugins )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n			<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_merge(\n				array_filter(\n					$active_plugins,\n					<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugin )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n						$slug = strtok( $active_plugin, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/\'</span> );\n						<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> !

Note this “LCP-TTFB” metric is simply the LCP metric minus the TTFB metric; this allows for measuring the client-side contributions to LCP by discounting any server-side variability in generating the response. The LCP-TTFB metric is important considering the lack of page caching on a local environment, and that certain optimizations may increase TTFB when page caching is not involved. For WordPress to scale, it&#8217;s important to have some <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/performance/cache/\">page caching layer</a> in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"analyzing-optimization-impact-on-lcp\">Analyzing Optimization Impact on LCP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to analyze the impact of the following feature plugins featured in Performance Lab:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-placeholders\">Image Placeholders</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#modern-image-formats\">Modern Image Formats</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#enhanced-responsive-images\">Enhanced Responsive Images</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-prioritizer\">Image Prioritizer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#speculative-loading\">Speculative Loading</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li id=\"view-transitions\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#view-transitions\">View Transitions</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a> since it was mostly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merged</a> into core as of 6.5. I&#8217;m also not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-optimizer/\">Embed Optimizer</a> since it primarily helps with <abbr title=\"Interaction to Next Paint\">INP</abbr> by lazy-loading and <abbr title=\"Cumulative Layout Shfit\">CLS</abbr> by reserving space for resizing embeds; the LCP improvement is difficult to measure for embeds that appear in the initial viewport given their cross-origin nature. Lastly, I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-worker-offloading/\">Web Worker Offloading</a> since it is quite experimental and it is only related to <abbr title=\"Interaction to Next Paint\">INP</abbr>. However, I am going to cover enhancements beyond Performance Lab being targeted for WordPress 6.9:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#nocache-bfcache\">No-cache BFCache</a> (actually, brand new to Performance Lab)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#script-module-deprioritization\">Script Module Deprioritization</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#minified-css-inlining\">Minified CSS Inlining</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first four Performance Lab feature plugins are all related to images. In focusing on improving the LCP metric, this makes sense because images are the LCP element 73.3% of the time on mobile and 83.3% of the time on desktop, <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance#lcp-content-types\">according</a> to Web Almanac 2024:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Bar chart showing the top LCP content types for desktop and mobile in 2024.

User-perceived performance is also important, as long as it doesn&#8217;t negatively impact LCP (which should hopefully not conflict). We&#8217;ll revisit this later with <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#view-transitions\">View Transitions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"modern-image-formats\">Modern Image Formats</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webp-uploads/\">Modern Image Formats</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern image formats, like WebP and AVIF, are able to compress much higher compared to older formats like JPEG and PNG. For example, an image compressed with AVIF could be 50% smaller than a JPEG with similar visual quality. It stands to reason that if an image is smaller, then it will take less time to download, and the LCP metric will be improved since the image can render sooner. This also addresses a common audit you encounter in Lighthouse to <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-webp-images\">serve images in next-gen formats</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Serve images in next-gen formats — Est savings of 46 KiB\n\nImage formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption.

This <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8008\">new part</a> of the HTML spec lets the browser compute the responsive sizes because lazy-loaded images are loaded after the page has been laid out. This enhancement <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/18/auto-sizes-for-lazy-loaded-images-in-wordpress-6-7/\">landed</a> in WordPress 6.7. Since then, the scope of the plugin has changed to improve the calculation of the responsive <code>sizes</code> attribute for images which are not lazy-loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress uses the same formula for constructing the default <code>sizes</code> attribute for all images. For example, if an image is 1024 pixels wide, then the <code>sizes</code> attribute is set to:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>This is problematic, however, because if the image takes up half the width of the screen, then the browser will select the image URL from the <code>srcset</code> attribute for the size corresponding to the width of the viewport, not the width of the actual <code>IMG</code> element. This is often fine on mobile when images are more often taking up the full page width, but on desktop viewports it means a much larger image will be downloaded than is appropriate for the container size. For example, consider these images in a Columns block (sourced from Wikipedia, as linked):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Bison standing among grasses looking toward the camera.\" class=\"wp-image-34617 not-transparent\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/American_bison_k5680-1.jpg?resize=700%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bison bison at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma.\" class=\"wp-image-36065 not-transparent\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=700%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_(HS85-10-13487).jpg\"><img alt=\"The last of the Canadian buffaloes.\" class=\"wp-image-36066 not-transparent\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_HS85-10-13487.jpg?resize=700%2C483&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>These images were all resized to be 1024 pixels wide, and so using the default WordPress scheme, they all have the same <code>sizes</code> attribute (as shown above), in spite of the fact that the first <code>IMG</code> element is twice the width of the second and third, and 1024px itself is about double the entire 645px width of the root Columns block on desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lighthouse, the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-responsive-images\">properly size images</a> audit correctly identifies these images as having inaccurate <code>sizes</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Properly size images — Est savings of 226 KiB\n\nServe images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time.

However, on mobile it&#8217;s actually the third image which is the largest (and the LCP element) since it appears on a row by itself:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36126 not-transparent\" height=\"455\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gallery-block-with-lcp-element-on-desktop.png?resize=700%2C455&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Desktop layout</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36127 not-transparent\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gallery-block-with-lcp-element-on-mobile.png?resize=394%2C700&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"394\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mobile layout</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, WordPress core adds <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> to the <em>first</em> <code>IMG</code>, of the bison and calf, even though it is never the LCP element. WordPress adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the first sufficiently-large image it finds on the page, making a best guess as to which is the LCP element. But even when core does add the attribute to the right image on a desktop viewport, it could be wrong for mobile, and vice versa. In <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/pull/73\">my research</a>, when WordPress core correctly adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the LCP <code>IMG</code> element on desktop or mobile, I found that 37% of those pages have a different <code>IMG</code> which is the LCP element for the other viewport. This means it&#8217;s only safe to use the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute on <code>IMG</code> tags when they are the LCP element on <em>both</em> desktop and mobile (and tablet too). But WordPress doesn&#8217;t know how the page is laid out (although this is starting to change in the case of block themes, as with Enhanced Responsive Images above). This is where Optimization Detective comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Optimization Detective plugin provides a framework to capture measurements from site visitors about what elements are displayed on a page across a variety of device form factors and responsive breakpoints (e.g. desktop, tablet, and mobile). These measurements are stored in “URL Metrics” (a custom post type) which can then be used by extensions, like Image Prioritizer, to apply more accurate optimizations. In this case, Image Prioritizer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Removes <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> from the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adds responsive preload <code>LINK</code> tags for the actual LCP element based on media queries.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the following <code>LINK</code> tags are added to the page:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-xml shcb-code-table\"><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span></span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison-2.jpg\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesrcset</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesizes</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen and (width &lt;= 480px)\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&gt;</span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span></span>\n</span></span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison-3.jpg\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesrcset</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">imagesizes</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"...\"</span></span>\n</span></span><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\"> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen and (782px &lt; width)\"</span></span>\n</span><span class=\"shcb-loc\"><span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&gt;</span>\n</span></span></code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Note how the first <code>LINK</code> preloads the second bison image on mobile, but the second <code>LINK</code> preloads the third bison image on desktop.

This is a very common way that imagery is added in page builders. Background images are also present in WordPress core, such as in some classic themes&#8217; header images; background images are also on any WordPress site using the Cover block when using a fixed background or when adding a background image to a Group block. The prevalence of non-<code>IMG</code> LCP images is captured in this <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance#lcp-content-types\">data presented</a> in Web Almanac 2022, showing that the <code>DIV</code> (presumably with a background image) is the LCP element ~26% of the time compared with an <code>IMG</code> at 42% of the time:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Bar chart showing IMG is the LCP element on 47% of desktop pages and 42% of mobile pages, DIV on 28% and 26% respectively, P on 6% and 9%, H1 on 3% and 5%, undetected on 3% and 3%, SECTION on 3% and 3%, H2 on 1% and 2%, A on 1% and 2%, SPAN on 1% and 1%, H3 on 0% and 1%, HEADER on 1% and 1%, LI on 1% and 1%, RS-SBG on 1% and 1%, TD on 1% and 1%, VIDEO on 0% and 0%, and finally H4 is the LCP element type on 0% of both desktop and mobile pages.\" class=\"wp-image-36141 not-transparent\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/top-lcp-element-types.png?resize=598%2C700&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"598\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The percent of pages that have a given element as its LCP.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with the <code>background-image</code> style is that it is CSS: there is no way for core to attach a <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> HTML attribute as can be done for LCP <code>IMG</code> candidates. Take the following page for example, where there is a parallax Cover block at the beginning of the content, followed by some paragraphs of text, and finally a Gallery block with five images in it. The black rectangle denotes the desktop viewport:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img alt=\"Depicting a desktop viewport with a Cover block at the top of the page, followed by paragraphs of text, and a Gallery block at the bottom of the page outside of desktop viewport.\" class=\"wp-image-36152 not-transparent\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parallax-cover-as-lcp-with-gallery-outside-viewport-cropped.png?resize=700%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\">Cover image courtesy <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/brown-buffalo-on-green-grass-field-8148551/\">Gintare</a> K. on Pexels.

Nevertheless, WordPress core is adding <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> to the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery block because it is the first sufficiently large image, just in terms of its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes. Additionally, WordPress core omits <code>loading=lazy</code> from the first three content images (the first three images in the Gallery), but they are not even visible on either the desktop or mobile viewports. The effect here is that the first three images of the Gallery are all loaded first <em>before</em> the all-important background image for the Cover block. Image Prioritizer fixes this by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Removing <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> from the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery, since it is not the LCP element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding <code>loading=lazy</code> to the first three <code>IMG</code> tags in the Gallery, since none of them are visible in any initial viewport.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding a preload <code>LINK</code> for the CSS <code>background-image</code> so that it is properly prioritized.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The preload <code>LINK</code> looks like the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison.jpg\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen\"</span>\n&gt;</span></code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Unlike with the responsive image prioritization, the Cover block here is the LCP element for both desktop and mobile, so here there is only one <code>LINK</code> and the <code>media</code> attribute doesn&#8217;t need to add any viewport constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the performance impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>436.5</td><td>433.9</td><td>-2.7</td><td>-0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>1042.4</td><td>579.8</td><td>-462.7</td><td><strong>-44.4%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>49.0</td><td>53.1</td><td>+4.1</td><td>+8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>994.6</td><td>526.9</td><td>-467.7</td><td>-47.0%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Benchmark results for 50 requests each, before and after, emulating Moto G4 over Fast 4G connection.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Benchmark command<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?disable_all_plugins \\</span>\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?enable_plugins=image-prioritizer \\</span>\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second-best improvement to LCP I&#8217;ve shown here in analyzing these plugins.

This was a feature plugin actually to bring the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to WordPress core, which was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/03/06/speculative-loading-in-6-8/\">merged</a> in 6.8. This API allows pages to either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prefetch a link, reducing TTFB to zero.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prerender a link, potentially reducing LCP to zero.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, Speculative Loading is somewhat cheating at performance because you can&#8217;t get any faster at loading something than to have it already loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The degree by which TTFB and LCP are improved is largely dependent on the “eagerness” of the speculation. There are three main eagerness values for when speculation starts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Conservative: when you pointer-down on a link.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderate: when you hover over a link (or <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372053392\">soon</a> on mobile when a link is in the viewport).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eager: right away without any user interaction. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial core merge, the default cautious configuration was to use prefetch with conservative eagerness. Conservative eagerness was to avoid unused speculations which can overly tax under-powered servers, and prefetching was to avoid potential compatibility issues with prerendering, such as with analytics or ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the impact that the various configurations of Speculative Loading have on LCP:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-content-justification-center is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-23441af8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex block-visibility-hide-small-screen\" id=\"play-all-button-row\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><button class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" type=\"button\">Play All</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<noscript>\n  \n</noscript>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" id=\"speculative-loading-videos\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>No Speculation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-b5fdba613d5f54f529164d484d92f964\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.17 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-1-none-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(experience in 6.7)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Conservative Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-4d5479e34dcbef7f8a0893f1cf0b6b4e\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.12 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-2-conservative-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2.3% reduction in LCP<br />(default as of WP 6.8)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-12afbcabcb1015bd3dd64bd0c56507e3\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>1.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-3-moderate-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">52.1%% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prerender</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-878b05b2c5f120b82213be7b98b2888a\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>0.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-4-moderate-prerender-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">98.2% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigation with prerendering results in a practically instantaneous page load with a near zero LCP!

This is great, but it&#8217;s almost too good. The navigation can feel so instant as to be abrupt. There can also be a white flicker between the page loads. To help in part with having too much of a good thing, the newest plugin to be featured in Performance Lab is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/view-transitions/\">View Transitions</a>. There is a new web platform feature for <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document\">cross-document view transitions for multi-page applications</a>, and this plugin brings these smooth page navigation animations to WordPress. With Speculative Loading and View Transitions, navigating around a regular multi-page WordPress site can feel as fluid as a single-page app (and without all the implementation complexity).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the impact on the user experience when navigating between the homepage and a blog post:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that these view transitions apply not only when navigating via links, but they also apply when navigating with the back/forward buttons in the browser:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, as nice as these cross-document view transitions are, do note that there is no LCP improvement to using them. As referenced previously with Image Placeholders, the View Transitions plugin provides a non-performance user experience improvement. So don&#8217;t expect to find any difference in your Lighthouse scores or LCP passing rates with this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Props again to <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/\">Felix Arntz</a> for spearheading this feature plugin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nocache-bfcache\">No-cache BFCache</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nocache-bfcache/\">No-cache BFCache</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nocache-bfcache/\">No-cache BFCache</a> plugin was part of the “beyond” part of my talk because it wasn&#8217;t among the plugins featured by Performance Lab. However, this is no longer the case since <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/releases/tag/2025-08-25\">v4.0.0</a>. In the previous section about Speculative Loading, I showed how prerendering enabled near instant page loads with practically zero LCP. But there is a much older browser technology for instantaneous page navigations: the <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache\">back-forward cache</a> (bfcache). This was also depicted above in the back/forward navigation videos with view transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote up a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">blog post</a> already all about bfcache and this plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">Instant Back/Forward Navigations in WordPress</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, webpages are generally not eligible for bfcache when they are served with <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code>. This header is sent when a user is logged-in and often on e-commerce sites for the shopping cart, checkout, and account pages. While it importantly prevents such pages from being cached by proxies, it also prevents the browser from storing pages in bfcache. This plugin removes the <code>no-store</code> directive. In its place, it ensures that the <code>private</code> directive is sent to prevent proxies from caching the response; also, to ensure preserve privacy after logging out, it includes logic to invalidate pages from the bfcache so they cannot be re-accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows is an example of a site running Twenty Twenty-Five with the BuddyPress plugin and Slow 4G network emulation. After entering an activity status update, I navigate from the Personal tab to the Mentions and Favorites tabs. Then I use the back button to go back to the Personal tab. Without bfcache, navigating back from the Favorites tab to the Personal tab is very slow since (1) the browser has to re-fetch the HTML from the server, and (2) the DOM has to be completely reconstructed. Without bfcache, there is also the unfortunate result that the drafted status update is lost, since the form field was re-constructed with JavaScript. In contrast, when bfcache is enabled, navigating to the previous tabs is instant, and the DOM is preserved with each navigation, resulting in the drafted status update being kept intact:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-sans-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-with-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without bfcache, the back navigation has an LCP of <strong>1.41 seconds</strong> whereas with bfcache the LCP is <strong>0.02 seconds</strong>: nearly instantaneous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#optimize\">reasons</a> why pages may be ineligible for bfcache than the <code>no-store</code> directive, but it is one of the most common causes.

Consider a template with an Image block and a Navigation block, where the Image block has a lightbox and the Navigation block expands on mobile. These blocks use the Interactivity API which involves adding script modules to the page with the necessary logic. As noted previously, one of the key design principles of the Interactivity API is <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>. This means that by design the Navigation block and the Image block do <em>not</em> need their script modules in the critical rendering path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that these script modules are currently loaded with high priority because the browser doesn&#8217;t know they aren&#8217;t critical. So they compete with the loading of critical resources, like the LCP image, even though script modules aren&#8217;t render blocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">separate post</a> all about this problem and the solution:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">Improve LCP by Deprioritizing  Script Modules from the Interactivity API</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, there are two ways to prevent script modules from delaying the loading of critical resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add <code>fetchpriority=​low</code> to the <code>SCRIPT</code> module tags and the <code>modulepreload</code> <code>LINK</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move the <code>SCRIPT</code> tags to the end of the <code>BODY</code> (the footer).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the results of these optimizations on an emulated broadband connection with an <code>IMG</code> as the LCP element:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>137.0</td><td>137.2</td><td>+0.2</td><td>+0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>406.0</td><td>368.8</td><td>-37.2</td><td><strong>-9.2%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>33.7</td><td>33.6</td><td>-0.1</td><td>-0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>371.7</td><td>336.0</td><td>-35.7</td><td>-9.6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a healthy LCP improvement, more impactful than using the Modern Image Formats with the AVIF format in my testing above. There are two plugins available on GitHub which implement these optimizations while waiting for them to be available in core:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-fetchpriority-low\">Script Fetch Priority Low</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61734\" title=\"Add the ability to handle &quot;fetchpriority&quot; to ES Modules and Import Maps\">#61734</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-modules-in-footer\">Script Modules in Footer</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63486\" title=\"Script modules should support being printed in the footer the same as classic scripts\">#63486</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"minified-css-inlining\">Minified CSS Inlining</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final optimization I&#8217;m analyzing is the impact of eliminating render-blocking external stylesheets. With JavaScript, adding <code>defer</code> to a <code>SCRIPT</code> is an easy way to prevent them from blocking rendering (assuming they can be deferred). However, this is not so easy to do with external stylesheets. CSS is always render-blocking because otherwise there is a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). The web platform does not (<a href=\"https://scottjehl.com/posts/async-css-already/\">currently</a>) provide an official way to opt in to <a href=\"https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/\">async CSS</a>. Instead, the best way to handle this is to inline the CSS in <code>STYLE</code> tags (at least for the critical CSS).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a vanilla WordPress install when loading the Sample Page, where the LCP element is text, there are two render-blocking stylesheets:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Navigation block&#8217;s <code>style.min.css</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Twenty Twenty-Five theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36207 not-transparent\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/twentytwentyfive-render-blocking-stylesheets.png?resize=700%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">External stylesheets in the DevTools network panel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these render-blocking stylesheets, Lighthouse is giving the page a 100 performance score. But as I&#8217;ve said before, just because you have a 100 score in Lighthouse, this doesn&#8217;t mean you can do more. Even with a perfect Lighthouse score, there is actually an audit that is pointing out the performance problem: <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/render-blocking-resources\">Eliminate render-blocking resources</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Eliminate render-blocking resources — Est savings of 0 ms.\n\nResources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources.

This can be done as simply as follows:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_action(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'wp_enqueue_scripts\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span> </span>{\n		wp_style_add_data(\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'twentytwentyfive-style\'</span>,\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'path\'</span>,\n			get_parent_theme_file_path( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'style.css\'</span> )\n		);\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>However, since the stylesheet is not yet minified (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63012\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets should be minified\">#63012</a>), you can hack in runtime minification using a plugin like <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/westonruter/09e553a7b66d1a2e68cd5a9ed351c59b\">Twenty Twenty-Five Stylesheet Inlining</a>. This plugin is currently just in a Gist since I hope this will land soon in core for 6.9 via <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63007\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets for block themes are missing path data for inlining\">#63007</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase the limit for inline CSS, all that is needed is a simple filter. The default limit is 20 KB which seems low considering the inline CSS limit for an AMP page is 75 KB. To increase the limit to 30 KB which allows enough room for the Navigation block&#8217;s relatively stylesheet to be inlined, you can use this PHP code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">30000</span>;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Plugin used for benchmarking below<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Increase Styles Inline Size Limit (styles_inline_size_limit)\n * Author: Weston Ruter\n * Update URI: false\n */</span>\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">-1</span>;\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>] ) ) {\n			$limit = (int) $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>];\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( $limit &lt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> ) {\n			$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">75000</span>;\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> $limit;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing this limit in core is being tracked in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63018\" title=\"Increase styles_inline_size_limit from 20,000 bytes\">#63018</a>.

I was a student working on a simple project, a portfolio website. I wanted to use WordPress because it felt easy to learn and flexible enough to build what I had in mind. I completed the project and proudly showed it to my teacher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of encouragement, I was told to scrap it. “Do it with raw PHP coding,” my teacher said. WordPress was dismissed as the easy way out. At the time, that felt discouraging. I followed instructions and rewrote everything in PHP, but the memory stayed with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What my teacher could not see was what I had already discovered. WordPress had opened a door. It gave me confidence that I could build something meaningful with the skills I had. That moment became a seed. It was the beginning of a path that would later shape my career, my community work, and my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learn\">Learn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I joined weDevs. This was my first real step into the professional WordPress ecosystem. Products like <strong>Dokan</strong> and <strong>WP User Frontend</strong> were not just plugins. They were solutions that empowered people. Dokan made it possible for anyone to create a multi-vendor marketplace without needing deep technical knowledge. WP User Frontend gave site owners control from the frontend in a way that felt natural and accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came <strong>WP ERP</strong>. This plugin fascinated me more than anything else at that time. The idea that WordPress could run HR, CRM, and accounting for a business was almost unbelievable. For me, it was proof that WordPress is like water. It can take any form. It can flow into any gap and solve almost any problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, I worked with newer products, including <strong>ElementsKit</strong>, MetForm, ShopEngine, GetGenie AI, which now powers more than <strong>2 million websites</strong> around the world<strong>.</strong> Over the years, I built an <strong>8-year career in WordPress product marketing</strong>, working with multiple global companies to grow their eCommerce, LMS, SaaS, and WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my learning did not stop there. Coming from a computer science background, I shifted into marketing. At first, I wasn’t sure I belonged in this space. But I discovered that having the knowledge of algorithms, logic, and technical systems helped me become a better marketer. It allowed me to solve business problems more effectively and to connect with product teams in a way that bridged technical and user needs. That blend of skills became my advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Shakespeare wrote, <em>“To be or not to be, that is the question.”</em> For me, the answer has always been to be—to be curious, to be adaptable, and to be willing to learn. Or in the words of Bruce Lee, <em>“Be water, my friend.”</em> That is what WordPress has taught me. Adapt, flow, and find your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-connect\">Connect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, I organized my first WordPress meetup. It was a small gathering, but the energy in the room was undeniable. People came together to share, to teach, to learn, and to encourage each other. That was when I saw the true strength of WordPress. It was not just software. It was a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that point on, I made community a core part of my life. Meetups turned into WordCamps. I spoke at events. I volunteered wherever I could. And I attended as many gatherings as possible. To date, I have been part of <strong>25 WordCamps around the world.</strong> Each one gave me new lessons, friendships, and a sense of belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I spoke at WordCamp Kathmandu 2019, I was nervous. I had fixed what I would say but my heart was racing. I kept thinking, <em>“What if nobody listens? What if I fail?”</em> When I walked onto the stage and looked at the audience, something changed. I saw faces eager to learn. I realized they were not there to judge me. They were there to grow with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a panel discussion where I sat together with my mentor, <strong>M Asif Rahman</strong>, and we discussed marketing WordPress products. That panel discussion gave me confidence I had never felt before. It showed me that sharing what you know, even if it feels small, can inspire others. After that, I participated in two other panel discussions: <strong>WordCamp Nagpur in 2022</strong> and <strong>WordCamp Sylhet in 2024.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I have served as a WordCamp Organizer, Speaker, Volunteer, Global Mentor, and Event Supporter. I mentored teams as they organized their first WordCamps, helping them overcome challenges and celebrate success. These connections showed me that WordPress is not just a platform to build websites. It is a platform to build people. It gives us the tools, but more importantly, it gives us the relationships that carry us forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, I was humbled to receive the <strong>Yoast Care Fund award</strong> for my community contributions. It reminded me that the efforts we give to the community, often behind the scenes, do not go unnoticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-contribute\">Contribute</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With learning and connection came responsibility. I knew I had to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contribution takes many forms. For me, it has been about building communities, mentoring, and supporting events. I have served as a WordCamp Mentor and Global Event Supporter, helping new organizers take their first steps. I have guided teams, answered their questions, and encouraged them through the challenges of organizing. Seeing them succeed gave me joy that no personal achievement could replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia holds a special place in my heart. I have been part of its organizing team three times so far, including working with the AX and communications teams. It was a chance to tell stories, welcome attendees, and celebrate the diversity of Asia’s WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I joined the organizing team for the first WordCamp Asia in 2022, it felt like stepping into history. This was the first flagship WordCamp in our region, and expectations were sky high. I worked on the AX team, helping to provide an amazing experience to the attendees. There were long nights, endless discussions, and moments of uncertainty. But when the doors opened and thousands of people gathered, it was worth it. That event showed me how powerful Asia’s WordPress community had become. It was proof that our voices, our energy, and our contributions mattered on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I continued serving as part of <strong>WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2025</strong>, and later joined the <strong>organizing team of WordCamp US 2025</strong>, one of the biggest WordPress events in the world. Being part of that team was a reminder that no matter where we come from, our contributions connect us on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, I was also honoured to be selected as a recipient of the <strong>Automattic Open Horizons Scholarship</strong>, which supports contributors from underrepresented communities in continuing their WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I am pursuing a <strong>PhD in marketing</strong>, researching Agile Marketing Methodologies for Promoting Digital Software Products. For me, this connects directly to WordPress. Agile and AI-driven methods are shaping how we market plugins, SaaS platforms, and digital tools. My research helps me give back not only to academia but also to the WordPress ecosystem by exploring new ways to reach people, improve adoption, and create sustainable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering, speaking, organizing, mentoring, researching — each role has shown me the same truth. Contribution is not about doing everything. It is about showing up, sharing what you can, and making space for others to shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-story-for-marketers-who-wonder-can-i-belong\">A Story for Marketers Who Wonder: “Can I Belong?”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a marketer, a writer, or someone who feels more comfortable with words than code, you may wonder if you truly belong in WordPress. I want to speak directly to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You do belong.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress needs your thinking. It needs your storytelling. It needs people who can bridge the gap between product and user. Your technical background, even if it is small, is an asset. Your creativity is essential. Your ability to connect with people is what gives technology meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I moved from computer science into marketing and found my place. You can too. You don’t have to be a developer to be valuable. Contribution comes in many forms. Learning, connecting, mentoring, writing, organizing—all of these matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: <strong>WordPress is like water.</strong> It adapts to the needs of its people. And in the same way, you can adapt your own path in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lessons\">Lessons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, three words define my WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Learn.</strong> WordPress taught me more than software. It taught me resilience, curiosity, and the courage to explore.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Connect.</strong> The relationships I built through meetups, WordCamps, mentoring, and organizing have been the most valuable part of this journey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contribute.</strong> Giving back to the community has been my way of honouring everything I have received.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes think about that moment in my classroom when my teacher told me not to use WordPress. At the time, it felt like rejection. Today, I see it as the spark that lit the way forward. Without that moment, perhaps I would not have discovered what WordPress truly means to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been my teacher, my platform, and my community. It has given me a career, friendships across the world, and a purpose that goes beyond myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also a loving father of a 3-year-old daughter and a proud husband. My family gives me balance and joy, and they remind me why community and contribution matter so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reading this and wondering whether you belong in WordPress, I want you to know that you do. Whether you are a developer, a writer, a designer, or someone still figuring out your path, there is space for you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by learning. Reach out and connect. Then, when you are ready, contribute in your own way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is how WordPress grows. That is how communities grow. And that is how we grow as people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn. Connect.

কিন্তু মঞ্চে উঠে দেখলাম সবাই শিখতে এসেছে। তখনই সাহস পেলাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>২০২২ সালে কমিউনিটিতে অবদানের জন্য আমি <strong>Yoast Care Fund Award</strong> পেয়েছিলাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-অবদ-ন-র-খ-ন\">অবদান রাখুন</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>শেখা আর সংযোগের পর বুঝলাম ফিরিয়ে দেওয়ার সময় এসেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি কাজ করেছি <strong>WordCamp Mentor</strong> আর <strong>Global Event Supporter</strong> হিসেবে। নতুন আয়োজকদের পাশে দাঁড়িয়েছি, তাদের সাহায্য করেছি। তাদের সাফল্য আমাকে সবসময় খুশি করেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp Asia</strong> আমার কাছে খুবই বিশেষ। আমি ২০২২, ২০২৩ আর ২০২৫ এ আয়োজক টিমে ছিলাম। পরে যুক্ত হই <strong>WordCamp US 2025</strong> এর টিমেও।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>২০২৫ সালে আমি পাই <strong>Automattic Open Horizons Scholarship</strong>। একই সময়ে মার্কেটিং এ পিএইচডি করছি, যেখানে গবেষণা করছি কিভাবে নতুন পদ্ধতিতে সফটওয়্যার প্রোডাক্ট প্রচার করা যায়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এসব অভিজ্ঞতা আমাকে শিখিয়েছে: অবদান মানে সবকিছু করতে হবে না, বরং যা পারেন সেটুকু নিয়মিত শেয়ার করাটাই আসল।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ম-র-ক-ট-রদ-র-জন-য-কথ\">মার্কেটারদের জন্য কথা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আপনি যদি মার্কেটার হন, লেখক হন বা কোডের চেয়ে লেখালেখি ভালো পারেন, তবে নিশ্চিন্ত থাকুন, ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে আপনার জায়গা আছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধু ডেভেলপারদের প্রয়োজন নেই। প্রোডাক্ট আর ব্যবহারকারীর মধ্যে সেতু গড়তে যারা পারে, গল্প বলতে পারে, মানুষের সাথে সংযোগ তৈরি করতে পারে, তাদেরও সমানভাবে দরকার।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি কম্পিউটার সায়েন্স থেকে মার্কেটিং এ এসেছি, আপনিও পারবেন নিজের জায়গা খুঁজে নিতে। শেখা, লেখা, আয়োজন, মেন্টরিং সবই অবদান।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-ক-ষ\">শিক্ষা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার যাত্রাকে তিনটি শব্দ সবচেয়ে ভালোভাবে বোঝায় &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>শিখুন.</strong> কৌতূহলী হোন, শিখুন, এগিয়ে যান।</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>যুক্ত হোন.</strong> সম্পর্ক আর বন্ধুত্বই আসল শক্তি।</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>অবদান রাখুন.</strong> যা শিখেছেন, সেটা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করুন।</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-ষ-কথ\">শেষ কথা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>শুরুতে শিক্ষক আমাকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে কাজ করতে মানা করেছিলেন। তখন খারাপ লেগেছিল, কিন্তু আজ বুঝি সেটাই আমাকে সামনে এগিয়ে নিয়ে গেছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস আমার শিক্ষক, আমার প্ল্যাটফর্ম, আমার কমিউনিটি। এখান থেকেই আমি ক্যারিয়ার, বন্ধু আর জীবনের উদ্দেশ্য খুঁজে পেয়েছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি একজন ৩ বছরের মেয়ের বাবা আর একজন গর্বিত স্বামী। পরিবারই আমাকে সব সময় প্রেরণা আর আনন্দ দেয়।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আপনি ডেভেলপার হোন, লেখক হোন বা এখনও নিজের পথ খুঁজছেন, ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসে আপনার জন্য জায়গা আছে। শুরু করুন শেখা দিয়ে, তারপর সংযোগ তৈরি করুন আর ধীরে ধীরে অবদান রাখুন।</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>শিখুন. যুক্ত হোন. অবদান রাখুন. এটাই আমার গল্প।</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/learn-connect-contribute-my-wordpress-story/\">Learn.

Baby steps. In any case, Core Web Vitals Assessment: Passed <img alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/plugins/local-twemoji/images/emoji/72x72/2705.png?ver=16-0-1\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I checked <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a> again, and I was excited to discover that my blog is now also appearing in field metrics for mobile as well! And like desktop, the CWV assessment is also passing for mobile. The <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux#:~:text=primarily%20that%20they%20must%20be%20publicly%20discoverable%20and%20there%20must%20be%20a%20large%20enough%20number%20of%20visitors%20in%20order%20to%20create%20a%20statistically%20significant%20dataset\">eligibility criteria</a> for the CrUX dataset includes that “there must be a large enough number of visitors in order to create a statistically significant dataset.” Granted, my site is still only getting enough traffic for origin-level metrics, and I can&#8217;t see field metrics for the homepage URL specifically, but it&#8217;s another baby step! (Or maybe a toddler step?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really been trying to double down this summer on tuning every bit of performance possible out of WordPress (on the frontend), using my site as a case study, and I&#8217;ve been sharing my findings in posts here. I hope the site traffic is an indication that the community has found my posts helpful. The learnings are also making their way into <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> feature plugins as well as in performance improvements on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/07/28/roadmap-to-6-9/#performance-improvements\">roadmap for WordPress 6.9</a>. I have some more posts that I&#8217;m working on. You can <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/subscribe/\">subscribe</a> to get them in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 27th (next Wednesday) at <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US 2025</a> here in Portland, Oregon, I&#8217;m giving a talk called “<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/session/the-site-speed-frontier-with-performance-lab-and-beyond/\"><strong>The Site Speed Frontier with Performance Lab and Beyond</strong></a>” at <time datetime=\"2025-08-21T11:30:00-07:00\">11:30am PDT</time>. I hope to see you there, but it will also be livestreamed and recorded. I&#8217;ll be blogging an elaborated version of what I have time to share in my talk. (By the way, if you are attending in person, check out <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2024/09/12/my-portland-picks/\">My Portland Picks</a> post for what I recommend visitors check out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One takeaway I&#8217;ll be emphasizing in my talk is that we needn&#8217;t settle with sites merely <em>passing</em> the Core Web Vitals assessment or achieving a “perfect” 100 performance score in Lighthouse. Why be content with a good 2-second <abbr title=\"Largest Contentful Paint\">LCP</abbr> when it could be half that or even practically zero? Web performance is a journey, and there&#8217;s always room for improvement. I can see from my blog&#8217;s field metrics, for example, that the <abbr title=\"Time To First Byte\">TTFB</abbr> is hovering around the threshold between “needs improvement” and “poor”. In spite of this, the frontend is so tuned that on mobile the <abbr title=\"LCP minus/discounting the TTFB\">LCP-TTFB</abbr> in CrUX is  400ms and on desktop it&#8217;s only 100ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally love optimizing the performance of WordPress sites, but I get it that this isn&#8217;t for everyone (nor should it be). By landing our improvements from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>, my hope is that WordPress core (and the ecosystem) will have best practices implemented by default so that site owners needn&#8217;t worry about performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I had to take some <abbr title=\"PageSpeed Insights\">PSI</abbr> screenshots to memorialize the milestone:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Field Data via CrUX</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Core Web Vitals Assessment for Mobile: Passed.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case the long complex story of how WordPress came to have a.com and.org variety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy and paste that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Michelle is well known in the WordPress community for her myriad roles, including Executive Director of Post Status, and program director for WP Includes. She&#8217;s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress Core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress Core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever searched for WordPress online, you&#8217;ve probably found both wordpress.com and wordpress.org at the top of your results, and like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan helped clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between wordpress.com and wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about how these two flavors of WordPress came to be, why they&#8217;ve both been key to WordPress&#8217;s growth and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspectives as a longtime user and advocate, with experience across both.com and.org sites. While Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his Core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions of .com and.org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress communities open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the projects seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by two guests today. I&#8217;m joined by Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, how&#8217;s it going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good thank you. We&#8217;re going to talk today a little bit about a subject, which I confess confuses me greatly. It&#8217;s the differences, the similarities between WordPresses variance, .com and.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that, I know it&#8217;s a terribly generic thing to do, but nevertheless, we&#8217;re going to do it anyway because we have a new audience member each time this podcast airs. So I&#8217;m going to ask you both to give us your little potted bio. Tell us who you are. So let&#8217;s start with Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hi, I am Michelle Frechette. I do a lot of freelancing type work in WordPress, and I also am the Executive Director of Post Status, and the Program Director for WP Includes. I have a couple podcasts, a couple different things that I do, lots of different projects I&#8217;ve started, none of which are relevant today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, I am Jonathan Desrosiers. I am a WordPress Core committer since 2018. I&#8217;ve been contributing to the project in some way since 2013, and I am partially sponsored by Bluehost to be a contributor to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, a lot of that results in, some people call it invisible work, but I&#8217;m behind the scenes just making sure people are supported properly, they have the resources they need, they&#8217;re not blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also do a lot with our build tools. So making sure our tests keep running and our different build processes to build the software that&#8217;s eventually shipped to the world is working in order. Yeah, you&#8217;ll find me a little bit everywhere. I&#8217;m a generalist. I have my hands in a lot of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for joining me and also for giving us your credentials there. That&#8217;s great. So we&#8217;re going to get into this strange topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I just carried out a typical search. I went onto a search engine. It wasn&#8217;t Google, by the way, but nevertheless, I went to a search engine, and I typed in one word, and that word was WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m now confronted by a result at the top, which says wordpress.com. That came in at number one. The second result for me was wordpress.org. And I&#8217;ll just give you the headlines. It says wordpress.com, this is the first result, wordpress.com, everything you need to build your website. And then the second result, download wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of you know the difference. I know the difference, on a very high level, I understand the difference, but when we get into the weeds, I quickly start to misunderstand what the difference is. But they are different. These two things are radically different in their intention, in the relationship they have with their users, the way that they&#8217;re monetised, and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s, first of all, just clear that up. Let&#8217;s rewind the clock, if you like. How did this all start? What&#8217;s the history of wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And then we can get into what the heck they are and how they&#8217;re different a bit later. So, I don&#8217;t know who wants to answer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;ll give a quick start. Then I&#8217;m going to let Jonathan get into the more technical aspects of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the nineties, blogging became a thing, and lots of people were establishing blogs online through things like Blogger, Blogspot and all those things. And then WordPress was one of the blogging platforms that you could create your blog on. All of them were free. I think I still have a Blogspot out there somewhere with really angsty poetry on it. So if you ever really want to find that out, sure, I could send you a link. But the idea was that, you know, you could get online and you could do the blogging things with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it was like, well, is it just for blogging or could it be used for other things? And so there are still people today that when you say, oh, I could build you a WordPress website, say, isn&#8217;t that just a blog? And to which I say, look at all of these websites that are built on, like the White House and NASA and all of these other things that are not just blogging, and are building their websites on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s different necessarily from wordpress.com where I do have a blog, right? I actually, it&#8217;s actually a website, wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com. I&#8217;m using the free .com to create a very quick, very simple, very easy way for people to sign up for one program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have several websites built on the .org idea, right, which is self-hosted. Find a host, download the software, or have the one button install, which is much more common now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also I have a paid plan on wordpress.com as well, which takes away any ad space, and also allows me to have plugins and themes within that website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I know at the surface level, what are the differences. I know that Jonathan knows much more about the software itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think you&#8217;ve highlighted some of the top level items, so we&#8217;ll circle back to those in a moment. But first, let&#8217;s get Jonathan&#8217;s take on that. So it&#8217;s the history question, really. What&#8217;s the history of these two different things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, so WordPress started as a project in 2003, and it&#8217;s what we call a fork. And so you probably know if you listen to this, that WordPress is open source software. And basically that means, it&#8217;s licensed under the GPL, and you have the right to download it, make modifications, see how it works. We distribute, all those things are your right to do with the software that is published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was forked from a project called b2 where a couple people were not really happy with the development that was happening on that, bugs weren&#8217;t being fixed to their liking, and so they decided to fork it. And so that was Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. And that was in 2003, and they called it WordPress. And so that was the beginning of the WordPress project that we know today that is now over 22 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, Automattic just turned 20 years old, so in 2005, Matt Mullenweg, one of the co-creators of WordPress, co-founders of WordPress, decided to create a company. And so he created a company called Automattic. And the company&#8217;s bread and butter was obviously WordPress, because he knew it very well. And so that&#8217;s how wordpress.com came about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in many ways it was the first true managed WordPress hosting platform, because you could sign up, you could get a blog for free, and you still can, and your URL will be, you know, nathanssite.wordpress.com, or johnssite.wordpress.com. And you can pay for additional things such as, the subscription plans allow you to have a custom domain name, and that&#8217;s evolved. The features that you can pay for has evolved significantly over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But along with this is the WordPress software that I mentioned earlier. And so the WordPress software is available for anyone to download and run, as I mentioned. And Automattic has a hosting setup that runs the open source software. And so many of the hosts that you have today, you all run that same software at the core of it, and it&#8217;s just a matter of what services are surrounded with it. What do they allow you to do within their environment? And how they support you in your journey to have an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the .com side of things was a very early move. So really, more or less as, I mean we&#8217;re into sort of the 20 plus years of history of WordPress, but right back near the beginning it was made easier to install. And nowadays, if you go to more or less any host that&#8217;s got any association with WordPress, they will offer some kind of one click solution, which makes it trivially easy, within a couple of moments, really, and a few buttons, you&#8217;ll have a version of WordPress. And I&#8217;m talking there about the .org side of things. So you&#8217;ll have a .org install of WordPress. Really straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you rewind the clock right back to the beginning when .com started, I&#8217;m guessing it was a much more painful process. There weren&#8217;t these managed hosts where you could do that, and so it made sense, I guess, into the market to put something where you didn&#8217;t need to install anything. You simply sign up, create an account, be it free or paid, we&#8217;ll get into that in a moment as well, and you&#8217;ve got yourself the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess that&#8217;s an important part to remember. It was much more difficult back then to do the .org thing than it is now. So many tools now making it relatively straightforward. I guess that&#8217;s a part of the success of .com, that it was just the first mover made it more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The WordPress project has several philosophies that we use to guide our decisions and how we choose what makes it into the software and what shape that takes. And some of those, for example, are design for the majority, decisions not options, clean, lean, and mean, striving for simplicity, out of the box software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you see this in the setup process in the five minute install. We really aim to make the installation as simple as possible for the software itself. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the surrounding database set up and server set up and uploading, getting the files on the server, doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s easy as a part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress could be two clicks to install. Could be really simple, email and password and installs it for you, but it doesn&#8217;t really, can only contribute so much to that cohesive experience, that all encompassing experience of what a website is, of what hosting is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:42] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think back to, again, the early days of blogging where that was the goal. You could change the colors behind it, you were limited to the theming that was provided with whatever platform you were choosing from. And the way that we&#8217;ve grown from just like, here are your five options, kind of like a MySpace idea, right? You&#8217;re kind of limited with what you could do back in those days as well, to where you can do a lot more now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even with .com, with the free plan, you have a lot more options than you did 20 years ago, 23 years ago. And if you upgrade to a business plan, then you have all the options basically that you have with the install, the .org install for yourself, self-hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I love about it is that I don&#8217;t have to worry about security, I don&#8217;t have to worry about traffic, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about upgrades. I don&#8217;t get a message that my PHP version is outdated. On some other sites where I&#8217;m self-hosting, I have to make sure that everything&#8217;s up to date all the time. With the .com. It&#8217;s one of those things that I don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, that is one of the benefits. Of course, I have only one site there, but I&#8217;m loving the fact I can walk away from it and not be having to check it on a regular basis. And I think that&#8217;s one of the beautiful things for people who are not tech savvy, because they can get in and do the things like they would in one of the competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a lot of this conversation is going to be done through the prism of history, you know, and decisions that were made which now perhaps people have got opinions about, maybe they think poor decisions were made, or brilliant decisions were made, they were made at a different time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to allude to what I said right at the top of this episode, which was that if you do a Google search, for just simply for the word WordPress, and that probably is the word that you&#8217;ve heard. You probably have no familiarity with whatever WordPress is. You just, somebody told you, you know, you were in a bar somewhere and somebody said, oh, you want a website? WordPress can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you end up at a search engine and in it goes, WordPress, and up come these slightly conflicting things. And I guess that&#8217;s maybe where some problems for end users begin. We&#8217;re in the inside of it all, so we&#8217;ve totally got a grip on this. We might not understand the intricacies of all of the bits and pieces, but we understand what .com is and we understand the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a question you don&#8217;t have to answer in a binary way. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a yes or a no. But, do you think with the benefit of hindsight, it would&#8217;ve been a good idea to call these different versions different things? So for example, WordPress could have been the .com or the .org, and it would&#8217;ve had a different name for something else. And that&#8217;s purely from a, keeping it obvious what the two different things are. So again, you can obfuscate or you know, dodge that question if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;m reminded of George Foreman, whose children are all named George.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Most confusing household ever. Without getting into the nuances of the agreements and all, how the permissions work, Automattic just has special permission to use the WordPress trademark. And so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And while there are some, there is some confusion that comes from that. In many ways, it also has contributed to the success of the project, because in the early days, it was very easy to get a site spun up on WordPress, on wordpress.com, and people started using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there are definitely people out there that solely started using WordPress because they got to wordpress.com and they were able to get a site. And now more and more hosting companies are much more capable, and we all have our own, like I said, I work at Bluehost, so for example, we have our own special sauce of onboarding, where we ask you a couple questions and we help you. We find that the thing people struggle with a lot is where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get dumped into WordPress, right? And you don&#8217;t know where to start. What do I need on my site? What do I make it look like? What do I need to do? And so using these onboarding questions to produce a starting point for you, that&#8217;s contextual to what you&#8217;re trying to do. And so that&#8217;s one of the things that we take pride in is our onboarding process that we&#8217;re working on and is available if you want to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that to say is that, you know, in the early days it was definitely a benefit. And now as the project has grown to over 40% of the internet, that confusion gets magnified in some ways. And a lot of times that takes the form of, as you said, Googling and finding conflicting resources as people not accurately describing the differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get a lot of tickets on Trac, which is the bug tracking software for WordPress, for the software itself, that incorrectly is saying there&#8217;s a bug, but it&#8217;s actually intended behavior, but it&#8217;s on .com and not in the .org software. The support forums are full of people that are not sure of the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s just important as community members that we keep this in mind, that it&#8217;s not always easy to understand, but a lot of times people just need a push in the right direction. And in some ways it returns to our philosophies of making it simple because the majority of WordPress users are not technically minded and so they probably don&#8217;t care about the difference, right? They just want their WordPress site. I have a site, I need it up, I need it to not go down. I need customers. And so keeping that lens in mind as well is helpful to get through this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is kind of interesting, I&#8217;ve been using the internet more or less from the beginning and although these boundaries have got really blurred, back in the day, anything which ended .org had a real kind of community, charity, non-profit kind of focus to it. I don&#8217;t know if you both remember that as well, but anything ended .org, it felt like there was a philanthropic purpose to it. And anything which was .com, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:11] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It was commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Commercial. Yeah, it for commercial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there go. So commercial, company, along those lines. And I don&#8217;t know when that was, but that just ceased to be a thing at some point. But back when .com began, naming it .org maybe was a bigger signpost than it now appears to be, if you know what I mean. Oh, look, it&#8217;s WordPress, it&#8217;s .org. It speaks for itself. It&#8217;s a philanthropic version or what have you. And that is maybe a part of the jigsaw puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, rewinding history, when the split happened between.com and .org, I&#8217;m presuming that nobody had any intuition that any of this was going to be successful in any way, shape, or form. .com, you know, the commercial wing could have been an absolute failure. The whole project could have collapsed within a couple of years. . org, again, nobody took any interest in it. It just didn&#8217;t work out. And it became, well, another b2, the annals of history. And it didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess once you&#8217;ve started down the path, you are going to stick with it. There would be no point 3 years in in saying, you know what? Everybody&#8217;s confused about .com, .org, we should upend the whole thing. I guess that&#8217;s off the table a bit at that point as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:20] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Well, I think that the generic web user who&#8217;s not a techie still doesn&#8217;t necessarily have an idea that the .org and .com were originally intended for different audiences, right? So I think that, I mean there are, definitely are some savvy people who understand that, but I think that the majority of people still, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a .io, we have so many extensions now that I think it&#8217;s kind of blurred what those actually mean. And if you actually go to register a .org, it&#8217;ll say, do you want the .com and the dot net, and the dot whatever else too? So that you&#8217;re kind of getting all of your traffic driven to the same place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that is something that, yes, we understand that now. And I think that we would&#8217;ve always understood that, the three of us, but I don&#8217;t know that that was such a huge distinction back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that it was one of those things where, you know, you have light versions of something or, you know, you have free versions of other things in life that aren&#8217;t software related that you can upgrade to or that, you know, free gifts with purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think the idea of, you could have this free one, or you can upgrade to these other things, or you could take it and run with it and do it your own thing, I think is something that made sense at the beginning, but again, can be slightly confusing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I do see people come to my meetup and they&#8217;re asking questions, and we all try to troubleshoot. We get them to log in, and we&#8217;re like, oh, okay, now I see, you&#8217;re using the free version, so you don&#8217;t have the ability to add this plugin or change your theme this way, or use CSS, you know, and those kinds of things, as you can with the paid version or with the self-hosted. And so I think that there is an opportunity for us to make that distinction in different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say one of the benefits, however, even if you start on the free .com, you can upgrade to paid and get that, or you can port that over to your own self-hosted as well. Other competitors don&#8217;t necessarily let you, like take your whole version of your website that you&#8217;ve built on their platform and bring it into a self-hosted situation like WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even if you made the decision to go with wordpress.com, and halfway through a build, or a year later, realise that you really wish you had done something different, we make it easy for you to be able to take that and move it someplace else, like Bluehost or you know, SiteGround or other places like that. So we make it easy for you. We&#8217;re not trying to shove you into one box and make you stay there and say look at all those people over there doing things you wish you could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I think that the underlying motivations was just fueled by the open source ideals, and the software belongs to the people and not so much specific companies or corporations. And so by putting it in .org, it was just more about being open and available and for the community, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt and Mike, when they forked b2, the intention was to get more people to work on it with them, right? And ensure that the software that they were running their website with survived and continued to grow and didn&#8217;t have bugs. And so I think that that was just part of the motivation where, I just looked it up, and the .org domains were intended to only be used by organisations. And it seems like the intention was to require documentation at some point, but it was never enforced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, when I got, in the late two thousands when I got involved, there was always the perception in my mind that you had to be an organisation to get one of those right? But that&#8217;s not actually the case. At least my early perception was that I needed it in order to do that. And so I wonder if that persists with other people as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that what Michelle also said resonates well is that, you know, no matter where you WordPress, you&#8217;re going to be able to take your site with you and go somewhere else. And that&#8217;s what makes WordPress great. And maybe you&#8217;re not even taking your site somewhere else, maybe you&#8217;re just taking out your content and, I don&#8217;t know, maybe feeding it into AI, or creating a book of all your posts, like a historical reference or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> That sounds kind of cool actually, yeah. And so being able to take your content with you and you are the true owner of your content, and you have the rights to it, is not something that&#8217;s true for other platforms. You know, not to name names, but there&#8217;s a lot of other website platforms where it&#8217;s difficult to impossible to extract out your content if you need to move somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:27] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It&#8217;s a lot of copy, paste at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, or like finding someone that knows how to create a browser extension, or a scraper or something like that. And so that&#8217;s always something that I tell someone looking to get started with a website where, you know, it might be easier to get started with this other service now, and it might be okay with your needs now, but if you outgrow that website or that service, it&#8217;s more difficult to bring it elsewhere later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re working on different ways with the data liberation initiative where we&#8217;re looking at ways to make our data more portable from other platforms to other platforms. And so I really feel strongly about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s the strongest point, one of the strongest points of WordPress is that you own your content, you control it, there&#8217;s no algorithm changes, you know, on Facebook where all of a sudden people aren&#8217;t seeing your content. They change a feature, right? People can&#8217;t react a certain way to your content anymore, and it affects your traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I always strongly emphasise that to people, because people don&#8217;t think about that. They think I just need a website, right? But they don&#8217;t think about, what happens if I need to make changes and this software doesn&#8217;t work, or this service doesn&#8217;t help me anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve definitely moved as a community, and by community I don&#8217;t mean the WordPress community, I mean the community of online users. We&#8217;ve definitely moved towards more gatekeeping and siloed consent repositories. You know, you think of things like social media, and essentially anything where there&#8217;s a, you know, a username and a password and a paywall. We seem to be more at peace with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings me to the next thing actually. And I&#8217;m sorry if this comment lands badly, dear listener, but I think there is something quite curious about our community. I think we are full of people who are very well intentioned, who have extremely benevolent motives, and often, I think, regard commercial things sometimes as something to be viewed with a little bit of suspicion. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve detected this kind of thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those things are things which drew me in. They didn&#8217;t alienate me. They were exactly the kind of people that I wanted to be around. But I do wonder if WordPress&#8217; history, so the .com, .org history over the last, let&#8217;s say 15 years or so, I do wonder if the flavor, the colour of the community, if you like, that we&#8217;ve got meant that we were going to have problems about this .com, .org split.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because on the one side, fierce, fierce open source advocacy people. You must own your own content. You&#8217;ve got to be able to download the software. This is terribly important, you want to be able to fork it at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on the other hand, a bunch of people are, well, that&#8217;s great you do that, but I&#8217;m happy over here. I&#8217;ll pay my fee for the premium version of wordpress.com. That&#8217;s fine with me. I&#8217;m okay with that. I don&#8217;t need all the bells and whistles that you seem to have. I don&#8217;t need it to be this version and that version. I don&#8217;t need this plugin or that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if the community that we&#8217;ve got is a part of that. In the mix somewhere is just what we&#8217;ve got. The people that are drawn to open source are going to view the .com side of things with a little bit of suspicion, and maybe see that, you know, that&#8217;s something which, gosh, we should not have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The only thing I&#8217;d challenge you on there is that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that people on the .com side don&#8217;t also care about the open source ideals. I think that many of them, if not all of them, do care about the underlying principles there. I think that, you always hear, you have to look after your own, right? You have to make sure you can pay your bills and you have a business and you. I&#8217;m US based, the American dream, right? Of creating a business and growing that into something sizable that can help people and benefit many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s my only pushback there is that they do. It&#8217;s not a binary thing. It&#8217;s definitely an overlap. And I like to think that there&#8217;s more overlap than we think. And that might be a little naive, but I do tend to think that it overlaps pretty heavily in that section there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think you are right, and I think what you&#8217;ve done there is uncovered the poor way that I phrased what I was saying. I think when I was trying to describe that I was, although I didn&#8217;t say it, I was trying to describe things from the .org point of view only. And so the nature of that community is fiercely protective of the open source values there and what have you. So yeah, you&#8217;re quite right. It felt, with a bit of hindsight, it felt like that question was coming from both sides and it really wasn&#8217;t. So thank you for picking me up on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:01] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It&#8217;s normal to be skeptical of other people, right? Especially when you see all these horror stories of this big business, you know, draining these businesses out there that are draining money out of everybody and raising prices and profits are through the roof, right? So it&#8217;s normal to have this skepticism towards commercial entities, and that they&#8217;re trying to do the right things and things of that nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to that, I just say to look at how the company and the space is contributing back and how they are ensuring that they do get their fair share of the WordPress pie, that is billions of dollars, on the last publishing that I saw, last report that I saw. But also making sure that that ecosystem is still strong, and supportive of everybody in the pool. To make sure that we can all compete to, you know, there&#8217;s definitely competition. We&#8217;re all going to compete together to make sure we&#8217;re trying to get more of the pie, right? And try to prove that our service or our products are the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, so I think a little level of skepticism is healthy. You always hear, assume good intent. I think that&#8217;s very important, and to obviously judge people by their actions and what they do to help grow that open source community while they&#8217;re living in that .com commercial space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, Michelle, if you have anything to add there. You probably have a different lens as the non-developer background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Definitely the non-developer background here. So you used the word community when you talked about that when you first started the question, and I think we have to think about the fact that the community, although it does encompass both .com users and anybody who&#8217;s self-hosted through .org. It really is the lion&#8217;s share of that community comes from that self-hosted .org side. Comes from the people who go to Meetups. Comes from the people who attend WordCamps. And most importantly, it comes from the people who contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that&#8217;s by volunteering through the .org and Make WordPress, whether that&#8217;s selling a product, or having a podcast or any of the things, a newsletter, any of the things that contribute to the success of WordPress overall, it applies across the board. But when you look at all of the volunteerism, and all of the unsponsored people, and even sponsored people who are creating, right? So Jonathan is a developer, he&#8217;s in the weeds with it. He&#8217;s got a sense of pride with what the community creates for each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you have a sense of pride in what you do, you have a loyalty to that as well. And so we are part of a group of people, a huge group of people, a multimillion group of people worldwide who are this .org community with some .com community peppered in. So of course there&#8217;s going to be skew, one direction versus the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily derision. That I don&#8217;t think people like necessarily look at .com and go, ugh, what do they say? The redheaded stepchild of, you know, .org or whatever. I think it&#8217;s more along the lines of, we know this, we use this. We want other people to use this too. This is our community and this is what we&#8217;ve built this community around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that democratising publishing is used by both, right? So if you look at .org and .com, we talk about democratising publishing. And the free .com allows people in incredibly socioeconomically depressed areas, and who have very little side income to be able to start a website. The ability to do that, whether it&#8217;s a website to talk about a service that they offer. Whether it&#8217;s a website just to blog. Whether they&#8217;re trying to monetize or not, there&#8217;s opportunities for people around the world to create a free, absolutely free website on .com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have it say, you know, michellefrechette.wordpress.com, because that&#8217;s what I could afford at the time. And then when I can, I either upgrade to paid, or I port that over to a self-hosted situation. So I think that both of them really have an amazing place in our ecosystem, but we tend not to see that when we sit squarely in one side or the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know? That&#8217;s a really interesting point, and one I cannot believe I&#8217;ve never thought about that. Over all these many years of thinking about WordPress and all of its different flavors and things, wordpress.org carries the word free around with it in my head. I&#8217;m thinking wordpress.org, free. I&#8217;m struggling to imagine a scenario where it is entirely free to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I used to say WordPress is free like a free puppy. A free puppy, you still have to take to the vet, and buy food, and get their nails trimmed, and buy the leash, and all of the things that go along with a free puppy. WordPress.org is like that. It&#8217;s a free puppy. You still have to pay for hosting and pay for themes, and I mean, you couldn&#8217;t do it fairly inexpensively, but not a hundred percent free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I was just going to add in, likewise, it&#8217;s not free to get to the point where it&#8217;s published. And another thing that you brought up, Michelle, that made me think is, I mentioned about judging companies based on how they contribute and the ideals they follow. But that also is true for the individuals that spend their personal time, or self sponsor, to contribute to the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they are not looking, most likely, not looking for your business. They may be if they&#8217;re a freelancer type thing. But in most cases they&#8217;re looking for just recognition, or maybe a job, or maybe sponsorship, so that they could continue to help the software grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s multiple lenses to that commercial side of things, right? Where we talked about .org versus .com, and commercial versus, open source. But within that, there&#8217;s also other layers of that as well where you&#8217;re contributing to make sure the software grows, so that your company continues to do good. But also maybe you just really enjoy the software and believe in it and want to contribute on your own to ensure that that same thing happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, interesting. I&#8217;m just going to finish off my thought from previously there. So the free to download bit, I think where I was going with that was that there&#8217;s a minimum of hosting. In order to get that free version of the software, the zip file that you download. In order to make it meaningful, you&#8217;ve got to at least do the hosting. The other bit, well, I suppose you could host it on your own computer, but good luck with that if you&#8217;re a newbie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:09] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I challenge that too, not necessarily, right? Like a website is only as good as who can access it, if they find what they&#8217;re looking for. But you could very easily just run WordPress on a Raspberry Pie somewhere in your basement that, you know, you use it to send requests to, to turn on your lights or something like that, or sync up your garage door. You know, you could theoretically use WordPress to do all these types of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would also challenge you to think outside the box a little bit on that. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a good idea and I&#8217;m not saying I might grunt at you when you come with your really weird obscure edge case in Trac, but that&#8217;s part of the great thing about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> But it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> You can use WordPress in many different ways, with many different combinations of plugins and themes. And that makes WordPress great, but it also makes it incredibly difficult to maintain and ensure that backwards compatibility, which is one of our main pillars, is sustained release to release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s fascinating. Yeah, what insight that was. That&#8217;s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial side, so the .com side where you&#8217;re paying a subscription if you want the different tiers and the abilities that you get for doing that, I don&#8217;t know if any of this data is available, whether it&#8217;s been published, whether it&#8217;s easy to access, I&#8217;m not sure. But I&#8217;m guessing that there is some through line between the profitability of the .com business side of things, and the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that many, many, many volunteers contribute to .org in every conceivable way. Whether that&#8217;s to the code, to events, to whatever it may be. But I&#8217;m imagining there is some connection. Maybe it&#8217;s attenuating a little bit more now. Maybe it was more in the past than it is now. But I&#8217;m imagining that there is a connection between sales, unit sales of the .com out into the open world, and people being paid, seconded, and what have you, to work on the .org side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any truth in that, if there&#8217;s anything there, but I&#8217;m imagining there is. If the .com business pays for the .org side to be as successful as it is essentially is what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:18] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I mean, historically Automattic has been the most sizable contributor to the project. There&#8217;s something called the Five for the Future Project, which is basically a challenge to companies, or individuals, making a living on WordPress to contribute 5% of their time back to the project. It&#8217;s a great initiative. That&#8217;s something that I was hired to participate in, so I&#8217;m very thankful for that because I&#8217;m able to have employment to work on open source software because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are some flaws with it in that 5% isn&#8217;t right for everyone. It&#8217;s a goal, right? It&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve talked about this at WordCamps in the past, but time is not necessarily a good measure because it doesn&#8217;t measure the impact you have, or the productivity, or the efficiency that you have, right? So you could spend one hour working on this one bug fix that could fix screen reader software for millions of people accessing sites across the world. That&#8217;s very meaningful and that has a very strong impact. But that&#8217;s very hard to measure. And hours is certainly not the way that you can measure that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good idea. I like that a lot of people rallied behind that, and that it&#8217;s a very strong program. There&#8217;s a lot of participants. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next iteration of that, which a lot of community members are discussing and, you know, I&#8217;m sure leadership is always thinking about that as well. Like, how can we improve this and encourage more people to contribute and give back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess all that to say that, you know, I guess .com and Automattic have contributed a sizable amount to the project over its history, and many other companies as well have historically contributed a lot back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So another thing that I wanted to discuss, which we haven&#8217;t discussed so far is the sort of different feature set that you get, and the evolution of that over time. So if I was to get a .com site back, I don&#8217;t know, 12 years ago, the things that I could do with that would be different to what I can do now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously with the .org side, all bets are off. You can do what you wish with that. It&#8217;s yours. You can do anything you like. But on the .com side, it was limited in certain ways. The software was designed presumably to facilitate whatever it was that their agenda items were, whether that was profitability, growth, simplicity to use, whatever those metrics were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at at the moment? Because it kind of feels like the two are coalescing, especially from a UI point of view. It feels like there&#8217;s moves at the moment to make the .com side be brought in line with the .org side. So the .org UI it feels like is going to be made available or pushed into the .com side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that kind of feels curious to me. It always felt that the UI was a big differentiator, like, you know, it looks different, you can immediately see that&#8217;s a .com website. Maybe in the future it won&#8217;t be. So let&#8217;s just talk around that. What are the differences in what you can do with the platforms? And then maybe we can get onto the UI and the UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So the free .com versus the upgraded paid plans have very different things that you can do within them. And then the paid plans are almost identical to what you can do with self-hosted. And so the difference really is you&#8217;re looking at the free plan versus any upgraded paid plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the free plan, you&#8217;re very limited into plugins and themes. There are very few that you can choose from. There&#8217;s more now than there were 10 or 15 years ago for sure. And I think my experience with logging into a free .com site looks different now than it did 10 or 12 years ago as well. But it still looks different than it does on a self-hosted WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That does change with an upgrade plan, because now you have a lot more features that you can add, you can bring in plugins, you can change a lot of the way that things look through CSS or through customisation. And so, yes, I think that the paid plan and the self-hosted are very much in sync with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the free plan still looks, to me at least, a lot different. And when I tried to add CSS to what it said, oh, you need to upgrade to do that, which I understand, right? So if they gave away everything, then there would be no money coming into the company to be able to operate and to pay the employees that actually work at Automattic. So yeah, I think there is still a difference. And I know that Jonathan probably knows a lot more about the technical differences than I do, but that&#8217;s my experiential difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:38] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Well, one interesting fact is that wordpress.com is just one multi-site. So when you create a site, it&#8217;s just all in the same instance of WordPress. You just have your own space on that install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is truly remarkable by the way. That is a quite numbing thought when you actually ponder that for a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:54] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> For anyone that&#8217;s worked with multi-site, you know how challenging it is to have 10 sites, nevermind millions of sites. So it&#8217;s definitely impressive and interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d also add that, you know, Michelle has talked a lot about more the personal style plans, right? Where we mentioned you get a free site if you have your site at nathan.wordpress.com. You can pay, you know, to get a domain, like I mentioned is the next plan. And then you can pay for more things like different plugins and different backups, whatever the features are that they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after you get past that, there&#8217;s additional tiers for people like agencies. There&#8217;s very, very high level, reliable hosting for companies that run Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 10 companies, whatever it is that they need more handholding. They need you to help them with engineering maybe with their team. There&#8217;s tiers all the way up to that level at Automattic. And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that any, you know, they have plans that compete with any different tier that may be out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s e-commerce plans and all of that. And, you know, at Bluehost we have e-commerce plans. We have managed plans just like they do. And like I said, before, we&#8217;re all trying to have our special sauce to make our home the best place to WordPress and for you to come and want to set up your site and make a living on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So then back to the question of the, what feels like an endeavor to make the .com look a lot like the .org. Now that was something that I caught sight of not that long ago. It was probably, maybe, I want to say about eight weeks ago, something like that. I don&#8217;t know if either of you caught that piece of news, and whether or not that&#8217;s in fact moving forward. But the idea is to make a default version of .org basically identical in terms of look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found that curious. I wondered what the intention was there. Was it purely just to have, I don&#8217;t know, one base of software that could be relied upon for both, or whether it was to make it easier to do a migration in either direction? I don&#8217;t know. So, I don&#8217;t know if either of you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> So a little, I guess a little history is that wordpress.com used to use the same dashboard as .org. And a while ago there was a project called Calypso, and that is basically the dashboard that you know probably from the last five years or so. And I can&#8217;t confirm this, but I believe that it was an exploration on what the dashboard, what a new WordPress dashboard could be. And I think that they&#8217;ve realised that having your own dashboard that&#8217;s different than .org is not really the best path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a few reasons for that. One is that we mentioned you have millions of sites on .com, right? That&#8217;s all very valuable feedback from using the software. And if they&#8217;re using a different dashboard than everybody that&#8217;s not on wordpress.com, that&#8217;s basically lost opportunities to receive feedback on the software that we&#8217;re building. And so that&#8217;s one aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other aspect is that, if you have a different dashboard, you have to have people maintaining that different dashboard, and making sure it works with all the new features that are added to wordpress.org. Make sure it&#8217;s sustainable and performant and all of this requires resources. But if you could adapt your products to use the same dashboard that everybody else has, then maybe you could take some of those resources and put them back to the .org software, instead of the internal Calypso project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should correct that, it wasn&#8217;t an internal project, it was used internally. It is open source and, especially initially there was a lot of encouragement for community members to participate in that. And so it&#8217;s not like it was a closed thing where they shut everybody out and they wanted, you know, it to be their own thing. It wasn&#8217;t trade secret type stuff. It was open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, those are just two things that stand out to me as reasons why you would want to use the same experience that everybody else has, as it just contributes to the greater good of the software and the health of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting, and again, something I hadn&#8217;t really thought about. The heuristics that would come out of .com. Well, for a start, it&#8217;s incredibly cohesive. That data set is going to be enormous, whereas trying to gather that from all the other versions of WordPress, you would obviously have to opt people into that to begin with. But also, it would be very difficult to gather all of that, whereas presumably the .com side of things has got that completely sealed up. So yeah, again, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is curious. I don&#8217;t really know if we&#8217;ll ever overcome in people&#8217;s heads the, well, for some people I think it&#8217;s a chasm. You know, it&#8217;s a really big divide, the difference between .org and .com. But I think we&#8217;ve done a fairly good job of explaining what the history is, why the things have been done in the way that they&#8217;ve been done, maybe a little bit into the future and how things are going to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any salient point that you think we missed there, but if not, I think we&#8217;ll round it up. So I&#8217;ll just ask Michelle first. Anything you wanted to get across about that before we knock it on the head?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:43] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think that we often talk about .org versus .com as though they were adversarial, but it&#8217;s really just a comparison as opposed to one being better than the other. I think you choose the option that&#8217;s best for you and your goals, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with choosing any of those options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d just add that with any technology or anything, knowledge is not always binary, right? It&#8217;s a spectrum. And so how can we better expose people to the concepts, better explain them to people so that it&#8217;s easier to understand and get up to speed on what different concepts are. Technical concepts, brand concepts, whatever that may be, software, and strive for simplicity, right? That&#8217;s our, one of our philosophies. And so how can we make things more simple so that more people are able to better understand and be empowered to have a better online presence by having a greater understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for picking that puzzle apart with me. That&#8217;s been really interesting. So Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers, thank you both for joining me today. Really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Thanks for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Always a pleasure.

She’s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes, supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever searched for “WordPress” online, you’ve probably found both WordPress.com and WordPress.org at the top of your results, and, like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan help clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. They talk about how these two flavours of WordPress came to be, why they’ve both been key to WordPress’ growth, and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspective as a long-time user and advocate, with experience across both .com and .org sites, while Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions .com and .org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress community’s open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the project seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/about/\"> Blogger</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Michelle&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com/\">WP Trail Buddies</a> on WordPress.com</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-story-of-wordpress/\"> The story of forking b2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\"> Five for the Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\"> Calypso</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"HeroPress: The Stone That Turned Out to Be Gold – My WordPress Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=8146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:188:\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10325:\"<img alt=\"Pull quote: WordPress is gold.

I just wanted to know what the fuss was about so I could talk with authority the next time it came up. What I didn’t know was that I was picking up a stone that would later prove to be gold — taking me from clueless newbie to community leader, and from replacing demo content to designing websites for real clients… and even offer consultancy services</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“The thing you throw away may be the thing you look for tomorrow.”</em> — Ugandan Proverb</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scratching-in-the-sand\"><strong>Scratching in the Sand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People often ask me:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Moses, tell us about your WordPress journey.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always laugh and say: <em>“Ah, my friend, it’s the story of the stone that turned out to be gold.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In life, we pick things here and there.

He had just started using it to build sites and was offering to journey with some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought: <em>“Hmm… let me check this thing for myself. If it’s nonsense, at least I’ll know. And if it’s good, I can talk about it without looking like I just fell off the mango tree.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t looking for money. I just wanted to <em>have an opinion</em>. You see, I’m the kind of person who enjoys jumping into conversations with some authority — even if I learned the thing yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-meetup-lost-in-the-blocks\"><strong>My First Meetup – Lost in the Blocks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first WordPress Meetup was all about Gutenberg. This was around 2018 — actually 2018. Gutenberg was super fresh and not even fully launched yet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/privileged/\">Laurence</a> was introducing this “block editor” thing. Everyone was nodding seriously. Me? Everything went in through one ear and politely left through the other without even greeting my brain on the way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as I was wondering if I had wasted my time, someone said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“If you’re here for the first time and you don’t understand anything, that’s okay.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside me, something jumped: <em>“Eh! That’s me you’re talking about!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mind-opener-offline-development\"><strong>The Mind-Opener: Offline Development</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Mr. Lutaaya  introduced us to building WordPress sites offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend, this was a million Dollar revelation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, I thought websites could only be built online — which meant needing fast internet and a good computer. And in Uganda? The Internet was like a stubborn goat — expensive and disappearing when you needed it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With XAMPP, I could build ten websites in a week without spending a coin on data. They were ugly, yes, but they were mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-falling-in-love-with-elementor\"><strong>Falling in Love With Elementor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, I met Elementor. Ah! It was like discovering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_(food)\">rolex</a> after years of plain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati\">chapati</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No coding headaches. Just drag, drop, and design. I paired it with the Astra theme plus Starter Templates (now called Starter Sites)  and started cranking out websites — or what I thought were websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a client needed a hospital site, I’d hunt for a hospital theme with demo data. School site? Same thing. All I did was replace demo pictures of dogs with cows, or gardeners with goat herders, and voilà — “Nice website!”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-drupal-disaster-that-changed-me\"><strong>The Drupal Disaster That Changed Me</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came my humbling moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Kampala in 2019, a UCU student asked me to help her migrate her site from Drupal to WordPress. I said confidently: <em>“No problem!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours later, I realized… big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t a “replace the dog with a cow” job. It needed a full custom theme. I needed knowledge on custom design which I had never paid attention to. I had no clue how to make one from scratch. That day, I felt like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda\">boda boda</a> rider asked to fly a helicopter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I failed her completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in that failure, a fire was lit. I decided to actually learn <strong>custom design</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-facing-real-problems\"><strong>Facing Real Problems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By January 2019, I built my company’s first fully custom site. It wasn’t perfect, but it taught me about responsiveness, optimization, and making sure a site looked good on desktop, laptop, and mobile. My first website was so beautiful on Desktop but so broken on Mobile. Everyone was complaining about it and I wasn’t seeing the problem until I saw it on my phone. Whoah, it looked so horrible that a witch’s house was more organized. Everything was flying to where it found peace but inside my heart, I was happy with the learning curve that was super achievable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was no longer a hobby. I was in deep. Curiosity building into a desire</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, I learned Divi. I learned Gutenberg properly now known as FSE (Full Site Editing). I even designed my first block editor site and felt like a genius. A few years later, I used the block editor to design an entire WordCamp website, with a friend (a member from the local community) — and it worked beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-real-gold-community\"><strong>Finding the Real Gold: Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The real treasure, though, wasn’t Elementor, Divi, or even my first paying client. It was the <strong>WordPress community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other tech communities can be stingy with knowledge. In WordPress, people shared openly. Sometimes the knowledge shared required resources that even cost money but people still offered. In my very first days Rogers offered me a starter package with hosting and management and by then we were using the .ml and .tk domains from FreeNom since it was free. The people I met in the community teach you how to do the exact thing they do for a living — no gatekeeping, no “first pay me &#8211; Awesome, Right? I thought so too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Contributing to WordPress is like washing the plate you ate on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a privilege, not a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-local-meetups-to-the-white-house\"><strong>From Local Meetups to the White House</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve spoken at Meetups, organized WordCamps, helped beginners install WordPress for the first time, and served in multiple WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I’ve seen where WordPress can go. It powers embassy websites. It’s used by the Ugandan State House. It even runs the White House site in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the White House trusts it, my friend, no one can convince me otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-rock-to-treasure\"><strong>From Rock to Treasure</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined WordPress at version 4.9. Now we’re in the 6.x series. I’ve grown alongside it — from a confused attendee to a community leader, from a “text-replacing” novice to a custom developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I picked up WordPress, I thought it was a useless rock. But when I washed it, shaped it, and put it in the fire, it gleamed like gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress is gold.</strong> Pure and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“The thing you throw away may be the thing you look for tomorrow.

After several thoughtful discussions and planning sessions, the series was finalized and officially kicked off on March 14, 2025. The complete nine‑event series was organized through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wpkolhapur/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kolhapur Meetup group</a>, with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hiabhaykulkarni/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abhay Kulkarni</a> organizing and volunteering for every meetup to ensure smooth coordination. I served as the speaker and mentor for each session, guiding both new and experienced contributors through various areas of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why We Started the Contribution Series</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a mentee in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/11/21/wordpress-contributor-mentorship-2024-q4-cohort-graduates/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Contributor Mentorship: 2024 Q4 Cohort</a> and successfully graduated from the program in November 2024. During this journey, I not only learned how to contribute effectively to WordPress Core, but I was also recognized as an <em>All-Star Mentee</em> and earned a place in the program’s <em>Hall of Fame</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, I received a <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/wordcamp-asia-2025-scholarship-recipients/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diversity Scholarship</em> to attend WordCamp Asia 2025</a>. These scholarships are designed to support individuals who are passionate about contributing to the WordPress ecosystem but may face financial or logistical challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by my cohort experience and the opportunities I received, I wanted to give back to the community. What better way than by becoming a mentor myself, guiding and inspiring others to start their own contribution journey?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s the core reason we started the WordPress Contribution Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Recap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the planning and preparation, here’s how the contribution series unfolded across different meetup topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstart Your WordPress Contribution Journey</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> March 15, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This opening session focused on getting contributors started with the basics — setting up a WordPress.org <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/creating-a-wordpress-org-account/\">profile</a>, joining global Slack channels, and understanding the various Make WordPress teams.

(I would love to see the results of a longer overnight or all-weekend hackathon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147970\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_389-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147969\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_884-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147972\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1384-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147963\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_757-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147968\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1259-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147962\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_832-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147977\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1462-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147973\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1254-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147974\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1027-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147975\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1053-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147966\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1938-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147965\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2067-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147967\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2001-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a wrap-up of the winners, <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1957194025271808088\">check out this great X/Twitter thread by Alex Reibman</a>.

Yusuf Olokoba said the name was inspired by <a href=\"https://x.com/levelsio\">Pieter Levels</a>, which is pretty cool.

For free and lower-priced accounts it runs a version of WordPress called <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/\">WordPress MS</a>, or WordPress Multisite, which is designed for super-efficient multi-tenant usage, which is what has allowed it to introduce hundreds of millions of people to WordPress and run at a huge scale. (It was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2006/10/mu-and-bbpress/\">initially called MU</a>, for multi-user, but we had to change it because someone squatted the name WPMU and built a business on top that was confusing users with commercial products. Such is my curse.) It revolutionized the hosting industry in a number of ways, including acclimating customers to per-site pricing instead of unlimited domains and raising the bar for what a host would manage for users so they didn&#8217;t have to worry. It has also provided a highly secure base login, which allows us to offer popular SaaS services, such as <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-stats/\">statistics</a> and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">anti-spam</a>, to all WordPress users, regardless of where they&#8217;re hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At higher-priced plans you&#8217;d get access to not just a curated set of plugins and themes but the ability to install anything you like from the ecosystem, which invisibly switches your account to <a href=\"http://wp.cloud/\">WP.cloud</a> in the backend that supports unlimited plugins and themes and custom code, in a way that&#8217;s still multi-datacenter and maintenance-free. This has been very successful and works great for a ton of customers, but it still puts an asterisk when you recommend WordPress.com to someone because they&#8217;d need to be on one of the higher-priced plans to get an experience of WordPress with custom plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time ever <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/08/12/for-a-limited-time-unlock-plugin-power-on-personal-premium-plans/\">we&#8217;re running a summer special where every single paid account gets that full WP.cloud experience</a> with full customization and control. It&#8217;s a test we&#8217;re running until August 25<sup>th</sup>. It&#8217;s WordPress, without the asterisk, without limits, implemented in a way that&#8217;s intuitive and safe for novice users, while also being extremely powerful for developers. If you haven&#8217;t checked out WP.com in a while, it&#8217;s a great deal starting at just $4 per month. I&#8217;m curious to see the results of how this goes.

The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, rebranding Do the Woo, and growing openchannels.fm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Bob Dunn. Bob is a long standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognizable voices in WordPress podcasting. Producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, he launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known Do the Woo podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce, but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the network features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organized and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges, and rewards, of handing over the mic, stepping into a more of a managerial and founder role and how he&#8217;s building a sustainable, collaborative, podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob&#8217;s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels or get the fire hose of all content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob also shares insights on rebranding a podcast, managing redirects, retaining audiences, updating hundreds of featured images, and ensuring continuity without confusing listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in open source podcasting, or building community driven content, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Bob Dunn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am joined on the podcast by Bob Dunn. Hello Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Hey, hello Nathan. Great to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for joining me today. Bob and I have been chatting for quite a long time. Actually over many years, we&#8217;ve been chatting for quite a long time, because we&#8217;re both very, very, very into the exact same thing, and that is podcasting in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should anybody not have heard of you, Bob, I know it&#8217;s a bit of a generic question. Do you mind doing your little potted bio to tell us who you are, and what you&#8217;ve been doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Been in business a long time. Two major businesses, branded myself, BobWP in 2010. Did a lot of stuff between then and now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, right now I am doing openchannels.fm. I&#8217;m running that, that is a podcast channels with, actually three channels, we&#8217;ll be explaining more about that. But yeah, I&#8217;ve just been in WordPress quite a while and I think since, oh, I don&#8217;t know, about 17, 18 years or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a fairly long time. You were one of the voices, when I joined the WordPress space, you were the established podcast voice I think. There were a few, but not many. And there&#8217;s very few that have survived. You&#8217;ve managed to, turn a living out of podcasting in the WordPress space. So Bravo, well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, it&#8217;s been interesting. It&#8217;s something you just kind of keep going and, you know, doing it all yourself. It gets to a point where, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of work, but it&#8217;s paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a little while ago, I&#8217;m going to say about, I don&#8217;t know, six months ago, something like that, you can correct me in a moment. But for the longest period of time you&#8217;ve had Do the Woo. Prior to Do the Woo, there was a bunch of other naming conventions for your podcast. What was it that, in the most recent past, why did you decide to jettison Do the Woo and create openchannels?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open channels, by the way, you can be found at openchannels.fm. There&#8217;s no hyphens or anything. It&#8217;s just as you&#8217;d imagine, openchannels.fm. Go and check that out. You&#8217;d be able to see what we&#8217;re talking about. What was the reasoning behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so I actually did the rebrand early June. It was at WordCamp Europe, but I&#8217;d been thinking about it for about a year. So you have almost seven years under the belt with Do the Woo, and it started out as a WooCommerce focused podcasts. And over the years I added more WordPress into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then over the last couple years I started talking about a bit more of the, you know, even outside the WordPress bubble. And I felt like something was always missing, because it&#8217;s kind of two-prong where WordPress developers, builders, a lot of our audience need to also be aware of other stuff that is going on around them. I&#8217;m not trying to push somebody one direction or another. It&#8217;s like just know stuff that is happening out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also for people that don&#8217;t know WooCommerce, expanding on that, trying to bring them in on other topics. They would look at WooCommerce or they look at WordPress and say, hey, you know, I&#8217;ve never really dug into them. I listen to a few of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two major things that really, I had been chewing on for like, oh man, it had to be almost a year, was growth and sustainability of the site. And, you know, it worked great when it was really WooCommerce focus, but people had the impression that, if they know Woo, they&#8217;d look at it and say, oh, it&#8217;s a WooCommerce podcast. I&#8217;m not going to check it out because I&#8217;m not using WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, people that didn&#8217;t know anything about it, they would maybe think it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, some wrapper or something. I don&#8217;t know what, you know, the title is like, it didn&#8217;t really define it. And of course they dig in a little bit, they learn what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, that was the impetus. It was like, I thought, man, it&#8217;s time to, as hard as it is to change a brand or even drop one that has worked for you, I thought we are moving more into content around the open web, open source, fediverse, all these different things. And I really want to make this something where, like I said before, people that don&#8217;t know WordPress or WooCommerce would come and listen to other stuff and maybe they&#8217;d check it out, maybe they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the WordPress people would continue, because we still have that content in there and they could learn about other stuff. They could learn about things that probably will really help their business even staying in WordPress. So I&#8217;m not, again, trying to push them out of it, it&#8217;s just open your mind a bit and learn new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The wisdom that I often get when I read around the podcast industry, and if you are just a consumer of podcasts and you&#8217;ve never really dug into that industry, in the same way that WordPress has just a gigantic amount in the background, as soon as you prize open the can and realise that there&#8217;s this whole open source software, and there&#8217;s events and all of that, the same is true inside of podcasting. There&#8217;s a whole industry going on in the background that you may not realise is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the pieces of sage advice which is often delivered, is to kind of niche down when you are beginning your podcast. Because obviously, you are going to be a small fish in a very big pond. And so the more specific that you can get, the more likely you are to build up that audience over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m guessing that that&#8217;s kind why you went with Do the Woo? So that it was pretty clear at the beginning, okay, we&#8217;re really focusing on Woo. So have you noticed that the pivot away from that, so from Do the Woo as a name, even though there was more content in there, to this much more open channel, so open source, whatever that might cover. Has your audience kind of, and I don&#8217;t really want to use the word forgiven, maybe I want to use the words, gone with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have they come across that brand transition willingly, or do you sense that some people have, you know, lost interest because now it&#8217;s not just Do the Woo? Because that&#8217;s, I suppose, something you have to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. You know, I&#8217;m sure some have maybe decided differently, but the interesting thing is how I built it and how I, even after the launch, reorganised it even more, is that all the content that was on there is still on there and continues to be on there. And so as I looked at how can I best organise it, I first put it into like five shows, and it still didn&#8217;t quite make sense and gel. So I thought, well, what if I do three channels, and I have an open source reach channel, an open web conversations channel, and an open makers channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the WordPress and Woo stuff went under the open makers channel. So now we still have series, like three or four series on WordPress. At least three series on WooCommerce, and then a variety of other stuff. So the thing was to get people convinced, and when I talked to a lot of people and I was at WordCamp Europe, you know, it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s basically the brand is changing, we&#8217;re expanding, but the stuff you&#8217;ve been listening to is not going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to really emphasise that. And it&#8217;s, yeah, there&#8217;s a bit where you think, oh, you know, am I going to lose it? But then they may come back, they may actually see that, yes, this is still existing, you know, getting this stuff out in front of people. And also, there will be now newer people that will, instead of looking at a name, Do the Woo and thinking, hmm, what do I do? Something like open channels, even though it is a lot broader, might interest them a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely the ability to tap into a new audience. So this podcast, WP Tavern, it has one show. And on a weekly basis we have a show and, you know, it&#8217;s me talking to somebody else. And I guess Do the Woo was a bit more like that. There was this one show and it would drop with a regular cadence and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it may have escaped people because we didn&#8217;t really introduce it as such. But open channels is not that formula is it? It&#8217;s more of a, kind of like a network, I suppose, for want of a better word. You&#8217;ve got your own mini kind of network of podcasts. So let&#8217;s just dig into that a little bit. So you&#8217;ve iterated it a bit. You started with maybe three shows and now it&#8217;s up to however many, we&#8217;ll get into that. Do you just want to go through what all of the different shows are, and broadly what they cover?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so what happened is during this whole time of change, and some of this even happened before June, was that I had a whole bunch of shows. So you go to the thing and you&#8217;d see like, I don&#8217;t know, there was like 15 shows or something. And it seemed a bit too much to me. You&#8217;d go there and it&#8217;d be like, whoa, you know? Realistic, you&#8217;d think, okay, you&#8217;d find the show you like and stuff and listen to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I was expanding the content I launched on June 5th with, there&#8217;s a website, there&#8217;s five shows and there&#8217;s some series under those five shows. And that still didn&#8217;t gel after I started getting in there and start rebranding it and working on it deeper, and I&#8217;m still working on it. I realised that what I&#8217;d like to do is eliminate the aspect of a show, so when they go there, it&#8217;s open channels, so it&#8217;s plural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the three channels that I mentioned, and underneath all of those are series. So there&#8217;s several. Some of them, there&#8217;s quite a few series under open makers. There&#8217;s some under the other two channels. And the reason I did that is channels are a lot more flexible, and also series are incredibly flexible. If you have a show and you stop it, it&#8217;s like, bam, you know, people, oh, where did that go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, what if I had these three umbrella channels that I could put series in? I could start them up. Some of them have been going on forever. Some may just go on a few months, but they&#8217;re part of that whole stream under that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody can go there and get all the podcasts that come in, or they can actually subscribe to the three channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the series are just a variety under it. And I haven&#8217;t really, the series are often focused more when they happen, the name of the series. I mean, I decided putting all the series on the site would just confuse people more. It&#8217;d be like, oh, what?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they can go through and they&#8217;ll see, you know, if they look through the episodes, they&#8217;ll see the various series. I mean, there&#8217;s, under open makers, there&#8217;s Woo Product Chat, there&#8217;s WP Behind the Builds, there&#8217;s WP Agency Tracks. And a lot of those were pre-existing. And so the other channels as well will have specific series under it, like Open Web Conversations has a series on the fediverse. One is on, oh man, I should have written some of this down. I can&#8217;t even remember all the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a few under that and there&#8217;s a few under open source. And what the beauty of it is too with as many hosts as we have now, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like around 25 to 30 hosts. They can pop around in different channels and under different series, or they come up with an idea for a show and we basically do it, and I say, okay, where should I pop that under? I can pop it under a series. It just makes it a lot more flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about it makes it sound more confusing. Going to the site is a bit more cohesive. But the feedback I got from a lot of people, they loved the idea of the organisation and they loved the idea of expanding into more of the open web and open source stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, well, let&#8217;s get into that bit in a minute. But let&#8217;s just stick to the consumption of open channels. So if you go and subscribe in a podcast player, so, you know, typically on a phone or something like that, to this podcast, WP Tavern, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward. You either drop in the RSS feed, which is, you know, available, or you can type in WP Tavern, and that&#8217;s then saved. And every episode that we produce, including this one, will appear when it&#8217;s published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you doing it for openchannels.fm? Because you&#8217;ve obviously got three channels, and then there&#8217;s different shows and series which live under that. How is it consumed? Is there just one overall RSS feed which will get you the lot? Or can you say, okay, I only want to, I don&#8217;t know, consume the stuff about the open makers or the open web conversations? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:55] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. What I&#8217;ve done is, you can, if you want the fire hose, you can go to openchannels.fm, it has its own feed, and then I do the feed for each of the channels. Like you said, open makers, open source and open web conversations. I thought of going down even more to every series, but I thought that just confuses people more so, you know, it encapsulates what each of those channels are about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, open makers is, somebody said, yeah, you know, it&#8217;s about people in tech making stuff. You make stuff, even if it&#8217;s WordPress only. Sometimes it&#8217;s interesting to hear how other people are making stuff. And it opens it enough where it&#8217;s long, that long funnel of people that make things, you know, whether the developer, designer, their marketing stuff, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was, yeah, I think that&#8217;s the best way to have people subscribe is, you know, they can get it all. But they can look at the three channels too. So if they go on their pod thing and look for open web conversations, that&#8217;s primarily what they&#8217;re interested in. What we&#8217;re talking about there, they can subscribe to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just from a, well, it&#8217;s not particularly technical, but from a slightly technical point of view, how do you manage that? If memory serves you&#8217;re using Castos, which is a sort of self-hosted, it&#8217;s a WordPress plugin, which binds your RSS feed into your WordPress website, but also carries the functionality to have different series and episodes all within the same WordPress website. I might have been kind of promoting that a bit, and it&#8217;s not the solution that you used, but I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it is. And so what it allows you to do, I could have actually created feeds for each series, but then I thought, is that going too granular? I mean, are you looking at all this stuff and thinking, so Open Web channel is like the default channel, I mean, openchannels.fm. Then you create three feeds for three shows or channels, which are the other three. And then when I do a series, I just choose to put it under whichever channel it should fall under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, okay. So you&#8217;ve basically got three places to go and update, and you can handle all of that in the WordPress admin and what have you. I should probably say that there&#8217;s a SaaS equivalent as well. You don&#8217;t have to use WordPress to make that happen, but it&#8217;s so tightly integrated with WordPress, it kind of makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other curious thing about it though is that for the longest time we were really familiar with you as a real significant piece of that jigsaw puzzle. You know, Bob would do the episodes. It is always Bob, in the same way that there&#8217;s always me on this. But with this, I think you said now you&#8217;re up to, did you say 25 or 15 co-hosts, something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> 25-30 hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s a lot. So you&#8217;ve got 25 other people who are helping you create the content. In effect, they have become you for these shows. They are the host, if you like, and they&#8217;re then interviewing people, and talking about whatever that episode may be about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you coping with that? How are you coping with no longer being behind the mic? And you&#8217;ve basically become a bit of a manager for a podcast network, which is curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;d like to, you know, I was talking to somebody about this and to me it was, it ended up being a goal that I didn&#8217;t know I wanted it to be a goal. You know, as I started to step back, I thought, well, you know, I&#8217;ve talked a lot over the years, I mean, more than anybody ever wanted to hear. I thought, well, maybe, you know, it&#8217;s time to get some other voices out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, I&#8217;m still doing the opening, but I keep myself as forefront as, I guess you call founder or whatever, of the podcast channel. And I&#8217;m cool with it. I love hearing the different opinions. It just was a shift for me at some point where I had no problem with it. And I think testing it in the beginning, I think the first three, so I brought on Brad Williams at the very beginning, because I didn&#8217;t want to do it by myself. We were just doing co-hosts and then we continued for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I brought on, later on I brought on Mendel Kurland, which at the time was GoDaddy, and Jonathan Wold who at the time, he was at WooCommerce, and now he has his own thing going on. And I would still be part of it, so it was the four of us. But I started liking the idea when I wasn&#8217;t part of it. It was fun to see somebody else take and run with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so over that period of years, I became more and more confident with people. Now, it&#8217;s basically, unless I have an idea for a guest, a lot of them choose our guests. They choose a topic because they&#8217;ve done this long enough. They know what I like to hear. They know what not to do and to do. I keep it pretty open for them. And they love that freedom because they don&#8217;t have to, you know, they come in, they do the recording, all the production stuff is not their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s also helped them to get to know each other more. They&#8217;ve gotten to know other guests. It&#8217;s built their brands some, I hope. And it became a point where I was just like, I thought this is it, this just works. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky with the hosts I&#8217;ve had, because they&#8217;ve been excellent. I never have problems. I mean, it just is a nice flow and they&#8217;ve all become good friends and, yeah, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think if you were looking at it from the outside, there are so many trip wires there where you think, well, that, couldn&#8217;t work. You know, 25 hosts, multiple shows, yeah, okay. Good luck with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But obviously, the history that you&#8217;ve got doing the shows and turning up to WordPress events, presumably you kind of knew most of these people fairly well already, so you had that rapport and trust with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a lot to trust them to just get on with it. To be able to say, okay, here&#8217;s the time slot, go off, get your guests and then just hand me the recording at the end, I&#8217;ve got complete trust in you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does sound like you&#8217;ve still got your fingers in there a little bit with the kind of like the post-production and the editing, and finally making the episode into what it is and all of that, and shipping it. Do you ever see yourself stepping out to the point where you don&#8217;t even do that, where it&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s just this network?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, I&#8217;d really like to kind of just have the role as founder. I mean, I&#8217;ve done a production and I&#8217;ve done this for, when we ran our other business before WordPress, the life and WordPress and stuff, we basically did everything, we didn&#8217;t have employees. So I&#8217;ve been doing this like over three decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I am at a point where, no, I think it&#8217;s time to step back from some of this production stuff. I would like to because it, yeah, it buries you. And when it picks up and you have quite a few shows in a row or something, there&#8217;s some serious work to do. And I get a little too over picky with editing, probably somebody could do it a lot quicker. I mean, I, it drives me nuts sometimes. I&#8217;m thinking, why am I spending this much time on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, I definitely am looking at some ways of doing that over the next few months. And looking at some other opportunities, but want to still be part of this, because it&#8217;s still my baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s incredible to have that level of trust. I&#8217;ve never yet managed to have that relationship where I thought that I wanted to step away. I think for me, the bit that I enjoy more than anything else is this bit that we&#8217;re doing now, the bit I&#8217;m having a chat with somebody. I really do like the one to one, or one to few. So the most I do is 2, 3, 4 really is the sort of ceiling, and that&#8217;s the bit that I like most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the bit that you&#8217;ve stepped into, curiously, would be something that I would not really wish to be involved in. I&#8217;d rather just hand that off to somebody, but I do know what you mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a perfectionist approach to the editing, and you can be halfway through it and think, I&#8217;ve just spent six hours and all I&#8217;ve done is remove empty space that nobody would&#8217;ve noticed. Anyway, it can be curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you still iterating? Are you still willing to take on some new voices? Are you still open to people approaching you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, we are. Because I think with this new brand, it&#8217;s kind of, before I get into that, I was just going to mention is that when you rebrand, I&#8217;m finding there&#8217;s a ton of work with post rebranding, and another one of my picky little, I don&#8217;t know what you want to call it, is I started looking at the site and I thought, well, I want this site to reflect the new brand a hundred percent. I don&#8217;t want people to go back and get confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been changing the featured images on 670 episodes with the new brand. And, you know, that&#8217;s just, again, that&#8217;s me. But I want, it was quite a shift in rebranding and I want to make sure that, when they even go back, they see that, yes, I&#8217;m still on the same podcast, you know, I&#8217;m still on the same site so. Now I&#8217;ve lost track of what you asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m actually going to pivot and just ask you a quick technical question, which is, did you close down your previous RSS feed, and rely on people finding the new one, or is there some clever way of moving people over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you have to redirect it basically. It&#8217;s not a lot of steps, but it&#8217;s steps that if you don&#8217;t do it in the right order, it can really pretty much screw up everything. And right now, I am having a bit of challenge with some of the stuff moving over on Apple and the feeds and stuff, and I just put in a support question with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you basically, eventually I&#8217;ll shut down a show called Content Sparks and Do The Woo. Because they were, they&#8217;re now under Open Makers as a series, but I kind of got to make sure all the things are connected and working smoothly. So it&#8217;s something, if anybody ever does this, whoever&#8217;s hosting your podcast, talk to them and ask them questions until you feel confident to be able to do steps one through five, without blowing up your whole podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit like when you move a website, there&#8217;s loads of different bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve got to get right and in the correct order so that, I don&#8217;t know, your email carries on sending, and all the posts that you desperately want to be still in the search engine results, that kind of thing. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of hoops to jump through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, so much so that a few kind of pivot ideas that I&#8217;ve had, not around WP Tavern, but around other podcasts that I do, I&#8217;ve kind of backed away just because the technical challenge was just not worth the time investment for the minor thing that I wanted to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the question, returning to where we got to. The question was, are you still open to modifying what you do or have you solidified for a little period of time? In other words, if somebody catches sight of your podcast or listens to this one and thinks, do you know what I could contribute? I&#8217;ve got an idea in the open space that I would like to contribute. Are you still open to new hosts or is it really just guests now? Have you solidified on the hosts? Where are you at with all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, the hosts, I think the hosts that are on it right now, they always have the option. I mean, they volunteer their time. I&#8217;m hoping they get rewarded by, you know, brand and exposure. And I know a lot of them have met a lot of people and built relationships that they never would&#8217;ve been able to because they actually talked with someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s another reason this particular structure of it now is so great because it&#8217;s so fluid. So it&#8217;s easy. If somebody comes in and has an idea, and it kind of gels and I think, okay, this is great, or maybe it exists with an idea I already have going or a series I do. Yeah, I&#8217;m always open to that because, you know, and some people kind of serve as, I don&#8217;t want to say substitute hosts, but they&#8217;re kind of there if I need to grab somebody, or I have an idea and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to host this and this person would be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, kind of a long answer there, but I&#8217;m always open, because this is not, this is a reason to change this is to keep it fluid and make it sustainable basically, where it can continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So definitely not closed, but you&#8217;re happy with where things are at the moment. If the status quo was to continue, that would be great. But, you know, new voices is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, not just with the personnel, are you kind of fairly happy with the structure that you&#8217;ve got, the three channels that you&#8217;ve got now? Have you solidified more? Because it sounds like there&#8217;s, you know, been a couple of months of chopping and changing over there. Do you think you&#8217;ll stick with what you&#8217;ve got?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s definitely, it&#8217;s where it is because, like I said, I did something completely different in the rebrand in June, and since then I did something different again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what happens is, when you rebrand and you start restructuring, what you thought was the right structure, you start looking at it and you think, oh, maybe this isn&#8217;t quite right. Maybe I should do it this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I talked to several people. Getting some opinions, it&#8217;s nice because sometimes I&#8217;m inside my own head and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to tell me if I&#8217;m just stupid or it&#8217;s a wild idea or, yeah, this is good. So, yeah, I like the three structured channels because it gives me so much flexibility under those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s pretty remarkable what you&#8217;ve managed to do. You know, you went from just many, many, many years ago, just beginning a podcast. And just hacking away at that for years and years and years. And now you&#8217;ve got this, kind of like little mini network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I&#8217;m getting the intuition, I could be wrong about this, but I get the intuition that you&#8217;ve leaned into the word open so that you are no longer limited to just WordPress as a project. Is that the case? Are you going to be leaning into just other open source things, whether that&#8217;s other CMSs or, I don&#8217;t know, anything in the open source space? Is that in fact the case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you know, I think what it is, in fact I was just talking to somebody, person that does accessibility, she wants to bring on somebody from Joomla and talk about accessibility because she&#8217;s under the open source channel. And exactly that. The impact of open source has been so huge and WordPress has been at the core of it. And WordPress will still be a big part of this podcast or this channels. And, yeah, I feel it&#8217;s healthy for my hosts. It&#8217;s healthy for everybody that listens, and everybody in the WordPress to hear about other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it just opens your mind. It has you thinking more about things and knowing what&#8217;s out there. And sometimes maybe you think, well, you know, I&#8217;m burned out on WordPress, but you hear some other stuff and you think, well, maybe it&#8217;s not so bad. You get a big picture of the open source and open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s certainly no shortage of things to talk about if you go into open. I mean, obviously WordPress is such a large niche that you really can talk about that until the cows come home. But the you prize open the can of open source, you know, you really are a hundred x&#8217;ing the amount of things that you can talk about. So that&#8217;s kind of really nice that you can, well, you&#8217;ve basically got an infinite horizon of content to make in the near and distant future. And I don&#8217;t suppose open source is going anywhere in the short, medium, or long term. It&#8217;ll still be around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, speaking of short, medium, and long term, if you&#8217;ve taken yourself away from the mic on every occasion to being in a few, and then kind of now being in the minority of things, and we talked about how you enjoy kind of managing the whole thing, even though it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of shepherding cats, let&#8217;s put it that way, in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the intention for you to sort of get to the point where you can be invisible in this, well, certainly from a public facing point of view. You wouldn&#8217;t have your voice in any of them at some point, and you would be able to, I guess, silently kind of move away. Is this like an end game here? What&#8217;s going on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:14] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> No, you know, I think I&#8217;m going to be involved, and the thing was built on my brand really. And I need to stay and keep my fingers in whatever way works for me. And, you know, I&#8217;m, I just turned 68, and I&#8217;m ready to do other things every once in a while like sit on a rock on the beach and look the water. You know, important things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no, it&#8217;s, I like looking at it as still being the face of it, but maybe, can I say not so much the voice of it? I&#8217;m out there, I&#8217;m still, you know, a huge part of it, and probably as long as I have my fingers in it, I&#8217;ll occasionally do little short podcasts. Right now, I do some on the updates on the site and, you know, I might even whip up something like, you know, thoughts from the founder, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, I like it, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, something like that. So there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t want to just become invisible because it really, how a lot of people have known this, and how I&#8217;ve built it is through my personal brand, and I think that&#8217;s important to stay intact with it. So I&#8217;m not going away anytime soon. And yeah, just need to reevaluate how many hours I put into it and how I can make it, again, more productive and sustainable. Because, you know, if I&#8217;m sick, who&#8217;s to do the production?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. When it was just you, you could just say, well, I&#8217;m not to record that one. I&#8217;ll just skip a week. But now that you&#8217;ve got like these 25 other hosts, you&#8217;ve got to kind of manage all of that. Oh, that&#8217;s really interesting. And of course, you&#8217;ve got to put time in the calendar to sit on the rock on the beach as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I know. I&#8217;ve got to get that in there, you know. It&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does this whole thing hang together from a financial point of view then? So is it a sponsorship relationship? Do you onboard sponsors to keep the whole thing, because obviously, you know, it&#8217;s trying to, you&#8217;re trying to support yourself in all of this. How does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s basically sponsorship. And the sponsorship model, but ever since I started this podcast, in fact, before I started this one and did another one before that, I started having sponsors right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your podcast is your main source of income, you got to have something. So yeah, it&#8217;s sponsorships. I am sure you relate to it yourself. And, you know, unless you&#8217;re famous and they just roll in, or you can get like a million subscribers paying $5 a month or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, we&#8217;re constantly looking for sponsors. And I&#8217;ve changed the model so many times over the years. And it&#8217;ll probably change a little bit here again soon. So it&#8217;s never capped at a certain number. That might be capped for a period of time. But, yeah, it&#8217;s a constant flex and it&#8217;s hard work. And that&#8217;s all I can say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I will just drop the URL for that. So if you&#8217;re interested from this conversation, if you&#8217;re interested in getting on as a sponsor for the openchannels.fm network, it&#8217;s the regular URL, openchannels.fm, but then append to the end of that, /sponsors, plural, or you can just find it in the main menu at the top of the site. That will also get you there and, yeah, you&#8217;ll be able to find out more about how you might make the journey into sponsoring that podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Bob, I know that you are a busy man. You&#8217;ve got 25 cohosts to shepherd and lots of editing to do, and dare I say it, sitting on a rock on the beach is also going to feature at some point during the day as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you so much for chatting to me today. Once more, if you want to check out what Bob is doing with all of his co-hosts and his new structure, go to openchannels.fm to find out more. Bob Dunn, thank you so much for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Always a pleasure.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/bobwp\">Bob Dunn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob is a long-standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognisable voices in WordPress podcasting, producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts. Most recently, he’s launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known “Do the Woo” podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years, to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the ‘network’ features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organised and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges and rewards of handing over the mic, stepping into more of a managerial and founder role, and how he’s building a sustainable, collaborative podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob’s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels, or get the firehose of all content.

In addition to all of the education that takes place at WordCamps, these are the main opportunities that committers (the folks who make the decisions on what code is ready to be shipped with WordPress) have to get to know each other and chat about ideas we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I&#8217;m serving as one of the leads for the Core Table at Contributor Day. It&#8217;s been a few years since I&#8217;ve been a lead on contributor day, and I&#8217;m excited at the prospect of helping new folks contribute for the first time while also helping existing contributors have an impact on WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also organizing the (largely informal) conversation amongst Committers and the (just barely more formal) security team&#8217;s in person meeting. These are teams that work together throughout the year and being able to take some time to meet each other in person is always a great experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an independently sponsored contributor to Open Source, I don&#8217;t have a company paying for my hotel or flight. While I did apply for the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/apply-for-the-open-horizons-scholarship-to-attend-wordcamp-us/\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, I was unfortunately turned down. This means that essentially all of my sponsorship money for August will be going towards my attendance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have added <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/aaronjorbin?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=aaronjorbin\">some one-off tiers of sponsorship</a> focused on WordCamp US 2025. There is also a free form for you to sponsor any amount you feel comfortable with or <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/get-in-touch/\">get in touch</a> if you have another way you want to support me. If there are any organizations looking to help support an independent voice inside of WordPress, please consider sponsoring my attendance at WordCamp US. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/sponsor-a-wordpress-core-committer-at-wordcamp-us/\">Sponsor a WordPress Core Committer at WordCamp US</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in\">Aaron Jorbin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:11:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Open Channels FM: Open Channels FM, the Channels, the Series: Rebranding Phase Two\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://openchannels.fm/?p=105774\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://openchannels.fm/open-channels-fm-the-channels-the-series-rebranding-phase-two/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:302:\"In a recent episode, founder BobWP gave you an idea of where we are going with in Phase 2 of our rebranding.

For example, I made an Oceania continent, which isn&#8217;t really real.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, what goes into organizing a flagship WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Karla Campos. Karla has been involved in the WordPress community for over 10 years. Starting out in Miami, and taking part in meetups and word camps before stepping into larger organizational roles. With a background in media and marketing, Karla brings plenty of experience in both web and events to the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla joins us today as a lead organizer for the upcoming WordCamp US 2025, which will take place in Portland at the end of August. Remarkably, this is her first flagship WordCamp, and she&#8217;s organizing before ever attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what motivated Karla to take on this major responsibility, how she balances the volunteer work with her professional life, and the challenges, expected and unexpected, along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the organization of such a huge event from working with a professional production company to handling the logistics, communications, accessibility requests, visas, and more, for a thousand plus attendees. Karla shares how the community side of the event is managed, the late night worries, and what it really takes, both in time and personal commitment, to make a WordCamp US happen, especially as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also highlights some of the initiatives for this year&#8217;s event, renewed efforts to welcome students and first time attendees, including student ticket pricing and the WP Trail Buddies Program to help newcomers feel at home. She also teases the introduction of a hackathon style contributor today, and new remote collaboration options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a WordCamp US, how it&#8217;s organized, how volunteers are supported, and what motivates people like Karla to invest their own time and resources, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Karla Campos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Karla Campos. Hello, Karla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Hello. How are you, Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good thank you. Very nice for you to join us today. I really appreciate it. Karla&#8217;s here today, we&#8217;re going to talk about WordCamp US, which is happening in Portland. Actually, I was going to say later this month, almost later this month. We&#8217;re recording it right at the very, very end July, 2025. It&#8217;s taking place toward the end of August, 2025. So it&#8217;s pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get into that, Karla, will you just give us your little potted bio. Tell us who you are, what you do in the WordPress space, and maybe very quickly just tell us how the heck you came to be organising a WordCamp, one of these flagship WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I always like to say that my involvement in projects sometimes comes about serendipitously. Just kind of like, hey, look, I saw that on the internet, it looked interesting, and I decided to join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually have about more than 10 years with the WordPress community in Miami. When I first moved to Florida, I started going to meetup groups and then I met the WordPress Miami organisers and started really getting involved with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My ex-colleague and coworker, her name was Jackie Jimenez, she unfortunately passed away, but we had a lot of great moments building things together in the WordPress Miami community. And when I saw the announcement online, I said, you know, she would&#8217;ve loved to do this with me. Let me check it out. And then that&#8217;s how I kind of just decided to join the organizer group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been with WordPress for over 10 years. I&#8217;ve been working in marketing. I used to work for Telemundo here in the Florida area. I used to work for iHeartRadio. So I have a lot of the media marketing background as well as the working on websites and copy. So I&#8217;ve been around for a while, just I&#8217;m more of like a quiet, in the background type of person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And have you attended any of these flagship, so the flagship ones are obviously WordCamp Asia, WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US. Have you attended any of those flagship ones in the past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:18] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Is it odd that this is my first flagship and I&#8217;m organising it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It feels almost surreal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just before we hit record, you said that, I don&#8217;t know, something like a month ago, you caught wind of the fact that WordCamp US still needed some volunteers. Have I got that about right? It&#8217;s about a month ago that you became involved in the organisation of the upcoming event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:38] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I would say May, I think May. You know, the dates are all come together. We don&#8217;t even know what month it is. Because we&#8217;re working on it so much in the backend. So I would say around May, when I first saw the, or when I got pulled into the organiser group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Since then, has it kind of taken over your life? I don&#8217;t mean that to sort of sound disparaging, but has it kind of crept in into all the different parts of your life? So you&#8217;ve basically got no free time left anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It has because you&#8217;d think, okay, you know, even because we do have a production team that&#8217;s helping organise the event to make sure it&#8217;s properly handled for all the attendees, because we do expect around a thousand, it&#8217;s always been that amount for a flagship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a production company working on the backend helping us with the production to make sure everything is smooth. But still, with that going on, I still feel like at 2:00 AM I&#8217;m thinking WordCamp US, WordCamp US. I know there&#8217;s something I have to do. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s split out what the production company do first of all. So I genuinely don&#8217;t know what that even means. So, a production company, I&#8217;m guessing you offload something, all the tasks that you can to them. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;re a commercial entity and they get paid to fulfill whatever contractual obligations that you&#8217;ve got. What is it that they handle? And then we&#8217;ll get into what the community side of things, the team of community, volunteers, and so on are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> So the production team is making sure that the venue and everything that happens at the venue is organised. So from some of the room logistics, so more on the venue side, that they&#8217;re handling that part to make sure that we can handle everything else that comes with organising, including all the planning around contributor day, showcase day, the photographers. So that&#8217;s our side, and then their side, the production team, is more of venue logistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And so do they handle things like, oh, I don&#8217;t know, the building of the sponsor booths and things like that? Because when you attend these events, there&#8217;s a very, very professional feel to them. So it&#8217;s not like you just show up and, you know, it&#8217;s kind of thrown together at the last minute. It really does feel, when you actually stop and think about it, you have a great sense of, gosh, there&#8217;s months, possibly years of organising that&#8217;s gone on in the background. Is it that kind of thing? You know, making sure that essentially when you walk in, everything looks right, everything that you can see, they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:57] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And then Megan Marcel, which is my co-lead organiser, she&#8217;s heading that part. So she&#8217;s managing that production company to make sure the venue and all the booths are on point, that they look like what they cost. Because, you know, those booths and everything that the sponsors spend, it&#8217;s not cheap things. They&#8217;re very luxurious. Sometimes more than others. But yeah, so she&#8217;s making sure that that&#8217;s covered with the production team. That it looks a hundred percent what the sponsors expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, okay then, let&#8217;s flip to the more community side. So everything that is not part of the production team&#8217;s remit. What are some of the tasks that you are finding yourself worrying about at 2:00 AM in the morning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:36] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Actually just making sure the communications, and all the attendees are getting service. So I am the lead organiser in charge of communications and marketing, and I have other team leaders under me, like Caroline Harrison, who is the team lead for the attendee communications. So we&#8217;re getting a lot of requests when it comes to accessibility, food that they have allergies or that they need visas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of traffic, of course, right now, I told you we had about 730 attendees already registered, so that email traffic is coming into our teams. So I&#8217;m just like, I saw an email and I know my team handled it, and I know they&#8217;re prompt but, you know, I wake up at 2:00 AM. Did I answer that email? Was that a nightmare? Did I miss something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s been in my life, you know, like I&#8217;m having these nightmares that I didn&#8217;t do something, but I did, because I&#8217;m a very responsible individual. But it just feels like that. It&#8217;s become so intertwined in my life that I&#8217;m having nightmares that I didn&#8217;t do a task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you get involved in the WordPress community, there&#8217;s obviously so many bits and pieces that you can get involved in, but very many of them don&#8217;t really, at the beginning, at least anyway of community involvement, don&#8217;t necessarily have crunch points in time. Obviously, as you get more into the community, there might be moments. You might be, I don&#8217;t know, a release lead or something like that, in which case there will be a date in the calendar where things have got to be all tied off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But mostly, there&#8217;s never that calendar moment where everything&#8217;s got to be finished. But you very, very much are faced with a ticking clock, aren&#8217;t you? Because come the date that the first people are arriving, the attendees are arriving, and presumably, before that the production team need to get in, and set up all the sponsor booths and make sure all of that&#8217;s taken care of and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a curious thing. So the stress, I guess, does pile up a little bit. And it would behoove all of us who attend events like this, just to pause for a moment and remember that it is done by a bunch of volunteers who have this ticking time bomb, if you know what I mean, in the back, where everything&#8217;s got to be finished by a certain date. And so I would just like to express my gratitude for the fact that you&#8217;ve stepped up basically and tried to fulfill that role. Appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:40] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Thank you. I appreciate the nice kind words, because it&#8217;s been a little bit hectic and, you know, it&#8217;s good to hear that people appreciate your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you actually had a chance to go around the building yet? I know we discussed this prior to hitting record, but is this more of a kind of, you&#8217;ll be showing up the first time in the same way that everybody else will, or have you managed to sort of walk the floorboards as it were?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Like I mentioned earlier, but we weren&#8217;t live, I&#8217;ve seen personally the venue in virtual tours and et cetera, but I&#8217;m coming to the Oregon area a week before. So I&#8217;ll be there earlier to see the venue. Go through the walkthroughs and do what the team does earlier, so that everything&#8217;s on point. But from what I&#8217;ve seen, everything&#8217;s going great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you get any sort of remuneration for any of the work that you do? So by remuneration, I&#8217;m specifically talking about finance. Does anything get offset? So for example, if you are based in Florida, presumably you&#8217;re going to be hopping on a plane, and there&#8217;ll be the food that you&#8217;ve got to eat during the time that you&#8217;re there, and the accommodation, the hotels and so on. Does somebody at the level of volunteering that you have nominated yourself for, does any of that get offset, or is this completely voluntary, where you&#8217;ve got to dig into your pocket for every single expense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:50] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> This is voluntary. So yeah, I&#8217;m just putting in from my end to support the community. So if ever you are planning on joining something like the WordCamp organisation groups, it usually is a volunteer thing. There are some scholarships but that&#8217;s, you have to apply for and it&#8217;s very competitive. So I don&#8217;t think everyone gets one. But yeah, no, everything that I&#8217;m putting in personally is through my own finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, again, obviously I gave you some thanks a moment ago and I&#8217;m about to do it again. Thank you for that commitment as well, because it&#8217;s not nothing. You know, going to Portland on an airplane from where you are, you know, it&#8217;s all the way across the country. It&#8217;s not a cheap place to reside in. Accommodation in and around the venue is probably at a premium, you know, it&#8217;s summertime, everything&#8217;s quite expensive around there. So it&#8217;s not inconsiderable, and there is an impact to that. So again, once again, thank you for taking the time, and also allocating the funds to make that possible. Obviously, events like this cannot happen without people like you doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:51] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And I think they must be done. You know, sometimes we have to make sacrifices to bring together something that brings people together around WordPress, which powers people&#8217;s businesses, their livelihoods. So, you know, I don&#8217;t mind putting in when I know that I make an impact in a community and helping those people with their livelihoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now you said that this all began for you in May, and we could get into what it was that exactly prompted you to do that. It sounds like somebody kind of sent something in your direction, which you responded to. So what have we had May, June, July, basically, you&#8217;ve been into this for a couple of months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any intuitions now of regret? That&#8217;s probably not something that we want to get into too much, but do you know what I mean? If you could rewind the clock to, let&#8217;s say April during 2025, did you get into this with your eyes wide open, or has it ended up being much more of a task than you imagined? What I&#8217;m basically trying to ask is, are there any bits of this that you think, gosh, I didn&#8217;t really anticipate that was going to be involved? This is way more than I was imagining biting off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:54] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, the time required to do all the work that needs to be done, and I&#8217;m a confident person, so I went in this, I have experience organising events for Telemundo, big concerts of 50,000 people plus. So I went in confident thinking, I got this. But as I got more into it, I just started to notice, okay, well, this is taking a lot of my time that I wasn&#8217;t prepared for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve adapted and I&#8217;m good now. It&#8217;s been a rollercoaster ride, but it&#8217;s fun for me because I&#8217;m that type of person who enjoys the challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s been fun, it&#8217;s been unexpected for sure. So we&#8217;ve had ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting through it, you know, and that&#8217;s the fun of a rollercoaster ride, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What are some of the things that you didn&#8217;t anticipate? Obviously, you said it&#8217;s ended up being more time, so yeah, more time has been required of you. But what beyond that? What are some of the things that you didn&#8217;t anticipate that you would need to do, that you have in fact ended up doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:44] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think all the time spent talking to people, it&#8217;s been really crazy. So I think I just didn&#8217;t anticipate the timing. So I think I originally volunteered for about 10 hours per week. Leading up to the event I think, a week before the event we&#8217;re supposed, or a month before the event, we&#8217;re supposed to be putting more in time, but this feels like a full-time job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh my gosh, you know, like I just didn&#8217;t anticipate for that. So it&#8217;s been kind of, like we talked about before, merging with my normal life where I&#8217;m just like, oh wait, my to-do list for my regular projects, and my family and everything is now part of WordCamp, if that makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So during the onboarding process that you&#8217;ve had over the last couple of months, how have you learnt what you needed to know? Because this event, I mean, it can&#8217;t have been thrown together in the last couple of months. Presumably you came along and joined at some point where many things had been set in motion. But how did you acquire the knowledge that you needed to do the work that you are now doing? Who taught you all of this and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, we do get the last year&#8217;s folder with all the information. So it came about from a lot of reading, asking past team members. So we do have some people who were part of the organizing team last year. Gail Wallace, one of our co-leads, she&#8217;s doing contributor day, she&#8217;s doing photography, she&#8217;s also helping with the lead organising. So she was very helpful in just kind of letting us know about the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have mentors like Kevin Christiano and Aaron Campbell from hosting.com, who also worked with WordCamps in the past. And there are mentors who we can always contact on Slack. So we do a lot of work on Slack, and we can always message them back and forth with any information any, hey, we need help with this. They&#8217;re always there to just say, hey, this would be a better practice from our experience last year. So we do have mentors there that help us, and that&#8217;s been a big relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How much time do you imagine, if I was to ask you on a, let&#8217;s go for a weekly basis. At the moment, so we&#8217;re three-ish weeks away from the event, something like that, how much time are you spending during the previous week? So the last seven days, how many hours do you think you&#8217;ve clocked up working towards this event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:53] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> At least, I would say 30 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wow, okay. And so that then presumably has had a material impact upon the regular work that you do. Now, either you are just superhuman and can add 30 hours into your working week with no perceived, you know, there&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s fine. I can just add 30 hours in. Most of us, including myself, could not do that. I would have to kind of offset one thing with the other. Have you done that? Has it had an impact on the business, the work that you normally do? Have you had to sort of downgrade the amount of time you&#8217;ve been spending recently on that kind of work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Not on my business, more on my free time, so I&#8217;m not getting out this summer to the pool as I would have last year. But luckily, we&#8217;re having a super heat wave in Florida, so it&#8217;s too hot outside anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s been planned, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:35] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It&#8217;s been planned. The universe is putting a heat wave out there, so now I can&#8217;t outside in the pool, but I would probably still take my devices out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Has the team had any concerns around attendee numbers? Because I remember I went to this event last year, and I actually don&#8217;t know what the numbers are, but I&#8217;m going to guess it was in the region of, I don&#8217;t know, 1,300 to 1,500, something like that, attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s obviously been a lot of controversy in the WordPress space since that event. I wondered if there has been some anxiety? I have a recollection that the event, the planning of the event probably would&#8217;ve been happening earlier than it did for this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just wondering if you could speak to that, whether or not the team itself are happy with the numbers that you&#8217;ve got so far? And whether or not things are kind of late in the planning, let&#8217;s put it that way. Do you feel that it&#8217;s all being put together in a rushed way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:23] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> No, I think we&#8217;re on track. I mean, we expected the event to be smaller this year because there have been discussions around different things that are happening in just the space, like traveling restrictions, people being scared to fly to the US, different things that we knew it was going to make the numbers less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now we&#8217;re up to 730 registered attendees. So we are planning for a thousand attendees. That&#8217;s our goal. Hopefully more. But yeah, we expected that it was going to be a little bit less than last year for the various reasons, including the travel restrictions and things that people do not want to come to the US for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Portland is ultimately a very friendly place and I think our concern is that everyone is safe and happy at the event. So I think we&#8217;re doing a very good job with that right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess also there&#8217;s maybe, the fact that an event like this has happened in the previous year at the exact same venue. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit that would be squandered there, if you know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea that you&#8217;d get a similar number of the exact same people, plus others, coming back to the same venue. I know for me at least anyway, it is quite nice to have the opportunity to go to different places. I&#8217;m going to be in attendance, so it hasn&#8217;t put me off. I&#8217;m still going to be there. But I think some people do like the fact that, you know, it&#8217;s in Portland one year and it&#8217;s in, I don&#8217;t know, Texas or California or whatever it may be in different years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that kind of speaks into it a little bit as well. But yeah, the whole thing around traveling to the US, plus the obvious problems that we&#8217;ve had in the WordPress space around the community and so on. And then maybe this third piece of it being in the same venue and in the same location, maybe all of those conspire to not make it as big as last year. But still, a thousand, which seems to be the target number, is pretty credible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you anticipate getting to a thousand? Is the trajectory at the moment, if you were to map that forward, do you think you&#8217;ll actually manage that? Despite the fact that it&#8217;s an aspirational target? Are you fairly confident you&#8217;ll get there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:14] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m confident. But I told you earlier, I&#8217;m a confident person, I&#8217;m always thinking positive. And we do have a lot of student initiatives, because we want to bring more people into the WordPress community, more students that perhaps haven&#8217;t even had the opportunity to experience WordPress, and the community, and how that can help them build their career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, our topic is sort of like the future of WordPress. And we&#8217;re doing a lot of student initiatives so that, you know, everybody gets a little bit of that WordPress community feel and that would, there&#8217;s a lot of students very interested, so I think we can reach the number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I certainly hope so. I mean, when you say students, I&#8217;m presuming from that, that you mean younger people by that as well. So not just people that are in education, but really aiming that target at young people in education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It always struck me when you go to these events that the demographic definitely skews older. I don&#8217;t mean, you know, particularly old, but you don&#8217;t tend to find a bunch of 18 to 20 year olds wandering around in large proportion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to me, it&#8217;s definitely in the late twenties, early thirties, forties, fifties and and upwards. So that&#8217;s been a definite charge that you&#8217;ve had then has it, to try and get younger people? Have I got that right? When you said student, did you mean younger people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:29] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, we are working with colleges because they&#8217;re very interested in how AI and WordPress are evolving, and everything that&#8217;s going around that. And through our event, the teachers that work at the colleges are very excited to connect the students with the future of the web and whatever&#8217;s happening with web development and AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re really interested in sending the students there because even though they&#8217;re educators, they&#8217;re not the innovators. So they want to come to WordCamp to connect with those innovators, including Google. Google&#8217;s liaison of search, Danny Sullivan, that was amazing to the students. They wanted to meet people in charge of the tech industry and connect there. So I&#8217;m talking about those students, yeah, the students that are in the tech industry that want to connect with the industry leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think things work slightly differently over here in the UK, but I know that in the US there&#8217;s this sort of concept of college credits, where you do a certain thing and it can count towards part of your educational program. You know, you can tick some boxes and it will get you to jump over some hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know if an event like WordCamp, in this case WordCamp US, do you know if an event like that can count? And does that in some way then kind of make it slightly easier to sell a WordPress event into that student marketplace, if you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It can, depending on the teachers. Some of the universities and colleges already have their structured standards on how credits work. But if we&#8217;re working with the teachers, sometimes they have summer school projects that they get extra credit, that helps their grades. So we can tie that in with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re welcome to working with any teacher who wants to help their students grow their career and willing to give them extra credit and opportunities. So it depends on the college and the teacher and what already they have established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, like I said, we don&#8217;t kind of operate that system, certainly for WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t think that would particularly count. But I know that those kind of systems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just pivoting to you a little bit and the work that you did in the past. Obviously it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a heritage in being involved in sizable events, credible events in the tech space, and perhaps other spaces as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you make of this event? How do you sort of see it? Do you see it as a sort of professional tech event, something that you may have attended on behalf of organisations that you were working for before? Or is this much more of a kind of community event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t really sum up the exact target of what I&#8217;m trying to say there, but I&#8217;m just really after a feel of what you make of the event in terms of whether it&#8217;s more, I don&#8217;t know, more friendly, a little bit less business orientated, and perhaps skewing more to community, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:05] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It is a friendlier atmosphere from the different tech events that I&#8217;ve been involved in that feel more serious. Because when you go to a WordCamp, you automatically feel that it&#8217;s a little friendlier, a little bit less corporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, everyone is very skilled. They&#8217;re very like awesome in their profession, but they&#8217;re also very down to earth and just willing to, hey, share a tidbit here, a tip here. I&#8217;ve even seen people help other people with their websites live at the events. Hey, look, I&#8217;m having a problem with my website. It&#8217;s not doing something on mobile. It&#8217;s not responding the way I want it to. It&#8217;s not responsive. Can you help me? And someone will stop and say, yeah, let&#8217;s sit down here in this corner. Let&#8217;s go to that room, and let me look at it and help you a little bit. And it&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t see at other conferences where people have this community feel. So I&#8217;ve always admired that about WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to encapsulate, isn&#8217;t it? What that thing is. But that thing is a thing. And what I mean by that is there is some quality of community spirit that definitely hasn&#8217;t existed at any event that I&#8217;ve been to outside of the WordPress space. It feels a little bit more like, heads down, you&#8217;re there for work, you must concentrate entirely on work, and maybe you&#8217;ll attend some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, after party or something like that. But again, the entire purpose of that will be business, business as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is much more of sense of camaraderie. And really, I suppose if somebody is listening to this and is kind of on the fence about these events, definitely I would draw your attention to that fact. And although if you are perhaps slightly more on the introverted side, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it a hundred percent easier to attend, and this feeling that you&#8217;ll just suddenly be embraced by everybody in the hallway, it probably won&#8217;t work that way. But there is definitely a more friendly atmosphere. There&#8217;s a different, and dare I say it, vibe going on, which I have always really appreciated. It definitely feels less corporate, more friendly. There&#8217;s more of an opportunity to make friendships, for want of a better way of describing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And also, I&#8217;m sure you know Michelle Frechette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:11] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think everyone knows Michelle. She&#8217;s organising something called WP Trail Buddies. So she&#8217;s actually connecting veteran WordCamp attendees with new attendees, so that they can have like a friend, a buddy at the WordCamp that they can do things with, so they don&#8217;t feel alone and they feel welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a new thing, and that sounds, you know, if a person is coming to WordCamp for the first time, they can go that route, you know, they can actually have somebody there with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I would draw everybody&#8217;s attention, if you&#8217;ve never been to one of these flagship WordPress events before, there is something particularly good about this Portland one. And the thing that I enjoyed so much last year, I enjoyed the event, but the venue itself was so brilliant, so enormous. There was never this hint of falling over people. There was quite literally acres of space to mill around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the hallway track felt very much, you know, you could take five minutes out and go and sit in the corner over there and get on with your own stuff, what have you. But this would be a really good one to attend. So I would definitely advise people, if you&#8217;re on the fence and you kind of think, I maybe should go, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Everything is geared up. We know what that place is like, the conference center is absolutely magnificent. So I would definitely urge people who are wavering, who aren&#8217;t entirely sure to give it a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I will put a link into the show notes for the initiative that Michelle Frechette is leading, the WP Trail Buddies. And if you&#8217;ve got concerns about showing up and just hanging out and feeling a little bit isolated, then Michelle will be able to introduce you to somebody who has been there, done that, for want of a better word. Again, another reason to have a little look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the tickets are really inexpensive. It&#8217;s not nothing, but at the moment, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s going to be any change in this. But it&#8217;s a flat hundred bucks. And, in all honesty, you&#8217;ll probably eat more than a hundred dollars worth of food in the time that you&#8217;re there. So the ticket price is just absurdly low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes, and we do also have a student pricing of $25, if the students show ID, or proof that they&#8217;re enrolled in school. So that&#8217;s also like an amazing deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now, the events often have a bit of a formula to them. There&#8217;ll be presentations, and they will run over a couple of days. So you&#8217;ll pick various tracks and you can go and see this person, and then come out into the hallway and hang out in the hallway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also there&#8217;s this idea of contributor day. And in contributor day, typically you would select a table, that table will be aligned to some core part of the project. So it could be photography, it could be Core, it could be, I don&#8217;t know, polyglots, something like that. And you would allocate your time and decide to work on that for the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a feeling that you are doing something a little bit different on contributor day this time around. Do you know about that? Do you want to speak about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> We are, but it&#8217;s a secret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:54] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> No, it&#8217;s a hackathon, but Gail Wallace is going to speak more about that in the coming weeks. So we&#8217;re just waiting for her to share all the information about what she&#8217;s been working on with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is something new, which is collaborating remotely for the Testing Team. So that&#8217;s fun. That hasn&#8217;t been done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the Testing Team will be open to kind of like a, more of like a Zoom approach. So it won&#8217;t just be people that are attending in the room. They&#8217;ll be able to offer the opportunity for people to join live, but remotely. Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. That&#8217;s a really nice idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hackathon, I was lucky enough to go to a hackathon earlier this year. I attended CloudFest in Germany, in Rust in Germany. Obviously you are not able to reveal whether you know or otherwise what that will involve. For the people listening to this, I&#8217;ll just give you some indication of what that might involve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a hackathon, rather than just showing up and deciding on the spur of the moment what it is that you&#8217;re going to be involved with. A hackathon is more of a kind of project based thing, where you come to the hackathon with a project that you would like to see finished in a certain way. So you might come and say, during the next day, we&#8217;re going to try and do this thing, so we&#8217;re going to move from here to here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that way, everybody coalesces on the exact same purpose, and tries to push that thing over the line. And in the hackathons that I&#8217;ve been to, again, there&#8217;s this sort of slightly tongue in cheek, fun, competitive edge as well, where at the end of the day, different people from the different teams sort of stand up and say exactly what they did and how they did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s kind of like a voting, there&#8217;s a panel of people who decide who the, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, who the winner is. So, again, obviously I&#8217;m not going to try and get you to reveal any details, but that kind of component, if it is anything like that, that really does bring something new and a bit of fun, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:40] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, I think people enjoy, when it&#8217;s friendly competition on something that they&#8217;re passionate about building, I think they enjoy that, like sports. So it&#8217;s exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good way of describing it, sporty, competitive edge kind of thing, isn&#8217;t it? Just sort of rehashing a bit of a question I asked a minute ago though. Obviously, like I said, you&#8217;ve been involved in these kind of events before in different spheres. Is there anything that you think, if you were to rerun your time, and maybe you&#8217;ll be involved in next year&#8217;s WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t know. Is there anything where you think, do you know what, I think we could try this, or we should jettison that? Obviously nobody&#8217;s implying that you are going to be the decision maker in any of this, but are there any bits and pieces that you think, well, we should definitely try that, or we should definitely maybe lose that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:23] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think we&#8217;ve had so many ideas, and we were all just kind of thrown together as a new team. And there were so many ideas flying around that we just couldn&#8217;t get to. So we&#8217;re doing the best ones that we thought about, but like there were so many others that we could&#8217;ve included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to be joining next year or not, I haven&#8217;t planned that out yet. But I think we&#8217;re going to at least have a discussion with the organisers about just kind of like looking back, hey, what did we like. Let&#8217;s leave little notes for the next year&#8217;s organising team so that they can, you know, they can know what to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now we have a roadmap together as a team. So I think it&#8217;s fun. And we&#8217;ll be way more prepared next year and add more fun stuff that we just didn&#8217;t have time for. But we&#8217;re all very creative, so you know how those discussions go when everybody&#8217;s creative, throwing ideas. And it&#8217;s like, all right, we have to pick just three because all of these are great but, you know, we&#8217;re on a time constraint, so we just execute these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s been fun all around. But yeah, just kind of getting all the ideas that we had together and executing them next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s kind of an important moment for these kind of events because they&#8217;ve been running largely on the same format for a really long time. And there&#8217;s definitely, in events outside of the WordPress space, there definitely are some of these fun ideas kind of creeping in, making it a little bit more entertainment, if you know what I mean, at the same time as being educational and informative. And I think it would be interesting to sound some of those different organisations out. Maybe go to the different events like DrupalCon and things like that, and see how they do things differently. See how sponsorship works and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, one question, which I think probably will be rounding off the episode, if that&#8217;s all right with you, would be to ask you, when does your involvement with this end? And I don&#8217;t mean, you know, that you might get involved next year. Because obviously I&#8217;m going to attend, and the minute the whole thing is finished, it&#8217;s kind of more or less over for me. I may go back to the hotel or spend a few days in Portland having a look around or what have you. But for me, the event has kind of finished at that moment. For you, I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s not the case. Do you have any anticipation of what it will involve in terms of collapsing the event down? At what point it will be considered to be finished by the team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:28] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, physically we have to be out by a certain date and everything cleaned out. So I am planning to stay there a little bit longer to handle that with the rest of the team. But I think we should be done by the 31st. Everything should be cleared out, physically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then of course we&#8217;re going to reunite and just kind of have a meeting and talk about the experience. And like we were talking about, what can we do better next year? And I think maybe, I think we&#8217;re still going to be in talks at least two weeks after the event is over to kind of close that out as a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So it definitely doesn&#8217;t end on the day that it&#8217;s going to end for me. So, yeah, there&#8217;s another example of the amount that people like you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would just draw attention to the fact that clearly this is not an event which is being organised entirely by you. There&#8217;s obviously a huge team of people going on in the background. And it would be remiss of us not to thank all of them. Can&#8217;t mention them all by name, but if you go to the website, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be places where you can go and find out who is involved in the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that if you want to get tickets and you&#8217;re a student, you can pay just $25 for a, basically three day event. I mean, that&#8217;s nuts. Or if you are not a student and you want to attend, then $100. And there are still, I think, some additional options that you can explore, perhaps sponsorship options and things like that, above and beyond that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Karla, that&#8217;s all the questions I&#8217;ve got. Is there anything that I&#8217;ve missed? Is there anything prior to recording to this you thought, ah, I must remember to say that, but didn&#8217;t get a chance to say it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:57] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I just want to say thank you everyone for even thinking of attending. It&#8217;s going to be a great event. We have amazing speakers all about the future of WordPress and AI. How everything in technology is changing, what that means for your business now. Or if you have plans for a new business, what it means for you in your career. It&#8217;s going to be just a great place to network with people in the field, and I&#8217;m extremely excited. So I hope you&#8217;re excited just like I am. And I hope to see you guys at the WordCamp US 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I should probably at this point mention that the links to anything that we&#8217;ve mentioned so far will be in the show notes. But if you do wish to find out more about it, head to us.wordcamp.org/2025. And as is usually the case, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of links at the top of that website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you can look at the schedule, so see who&#8217;s speaking. You can look and dig into the location and about it. And obviously buying the tickets as well, that&#8217;s all going to be there. So us.wordcamp.org/2025, the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There we go. Thank you very much for chatting to me today, Karla Campos. Really, really appreciate it. And very, very best of luck with the event. I hope to see you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:07] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KarlaJCampos/\">Karla Campos</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla has been involved in the WordPress community for over 10 years, starting out in Miami and taking part in meetups and WordCamps before stepping into larger organisational roles. With a background in media and marketing, Karla brings plenty of experience in both web and events to the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla joins us today as a lead organiser for the upcoming WordCamp US 2025, which will take place in Portland at the end of August. Remarkably, this is her first flagship WordCamp, she&#8217;s organising before ever attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what motivated Karla to take on this major responsibility, how she balances the volunteer work with her professional life, and the challenges, expected and unexpected, along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the organisation of such a huge event, from working with a professional production company to handling the logistics, communications, accessibility requests, visas, and more for a thousand-plus attendees. Karla shares how the community side of the event is managed, the late-night worries, and what it really takes, both in time and personal commitment, to make WordCamp US happen, especially as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also highlights some new initiatives for this year’s event, renewed efforts to welcome students and first-time attendees, including student ticket pricing and the WP Trail Buddy&#8217;s program to help newcomers feel at home. She also teases the introduction of a hackathon-style Contributor Day and new remote collaboration options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of WordCamp US, how it’s organised, how volunteers are supported, and what motivates people like Karla to invest their own time and resources, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US 2025</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/navigating-wordcamp-with-confidence-meet-your-wp-trail-buddy/\"> WP Trail Buddy</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WordCamp Central: First-Ever WordPress Campus Connect in Southeast Asia Kicks Off\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=11510566\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2025/08/first-ever-wordpress-campus-connect-in-southeast-asia-kicks-off/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7991:\"<p>Last July 25, 2025, WordPress Campus Connect finally made its mark in Southeast Asia by holding its first-ever event in the region in the City of Golden Friendship, Cagayan de Oro (CDO) City, Philippines. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513820\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXeTSe31BWPdP76V_oKAUARZoHIF06ayAveRaIHq52bYGiSP0ZJskLfxhX-zPfy-AkhBcElYsS_IqtnVSAQbs9DCUErozmJVpJL-GK9P6EWL_QskgpCsrt9w8NZLPs8VoKTvsK_2Rw.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pictured: The WordPress CDO and Iloilo teams, speakers, and the PHINMA-COC students who attended the event. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was held at PHINMA-Cagayan de Oro College. Over 100 students and school staff warmly welcomed the Philippines WordPress chapters that organized the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress CDO chapter, with help from its sister organizations in WordPress Iloilo and WordPress Iligan, conceptualized this initiative as a bridge between traditional, controlled classroom learning and real-world practices and insights practiced by full-time WordPress practitioners. The event is also in line with the group’s commitment to upholding WordPress&#8217;s original mission of being a platform for “everyone”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the day&#8217;s presentations were centered around possible career paths that the student attendees might consider exploring after graduation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513819\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXcWlJIctiTlyT6bfjjZ58Yr6B566Zqi-YXMtBKR9fNuYUPyNCos9rmp-J-cUpDlSEvrqvbgVaD4J24sRn2or040Dy0vjZDclaIzNd_w_kkGHFtLnuIWCaBKvDAbV9Qg7U_70SrM2w.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After the opening address by Mr. RJ Cainglet, SBO Adviser of College of Information Technology, Mr. John Tañedo, a 15-year web designer and brand strategist, started the presentations with a talk that was simply entitled “Careers in WordPress”. His talk was straight-laced in its assessment of the current realities facing job seekers in the real world, particularly in freelancing and working as a part of a small-business operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Mr. Tañedo was effusive in WordPress&#8217;s capabilities of giving just about anyone a leg up in starting careers in the digital space, he emphasized the need for students to be aware of the responsibilities that are actually needed for their careers, particularly if they are aiming to be either developers, designers, or marketers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Kim Isaiah Valencia, a full-time WordPress developer and a core member of WordPress Iloilo, continued the afternoon by holding a quick workshop on WordPress installation, themes, plugins, and hosting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513816\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXeXHmu-bb_H54eLNgn82hlp_kUcN1l5psABKgH6juQ0hrndwUZURAyE-9CSxf7c7Qxxg8BOfcD9ftexxD8d0BbdTa_R_k4WSDSTGk-okRsEwaOV0xkFV77lrtBj-YNUSghayqvc.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mr. Valencia and Mr. Hao guiding the student participants in installing WordPress on their laptops.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a room packed with students starting on their WordPress journeys, Mr. Valencia took the time to track each row&#8217;s progress on installing WordPress on the devices they have with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Kyne Hao, a UI/UX designer and advocate, continued the pace with his talk on Design Thinking. He argued for the need for human-centered design, as design itself is observable in everyday things like appliances and furniture, as opposed to being just applied digitally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Hao laid out how students can practice simple design thinking frameworks by focusing on the tenets of Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping, and Testing.

For $20 per month you get a fabulous buddy to co-create plugins and themes for WordPress or scripts and modules for other purposes. It works right there in your terminal window. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helped me a great deal writing a plugin for the Gutenberg Changelog podcast so I can build a great podcast landing page. I needed additional social link icons and created block bindings for episode meta and podcast options data. Block variations will help me add the blocks to the inserter, and I don&#8217;t have to write block markup. Then I created a podcast archive template that I registered directly from the plugin. I am not yet done testing, but if you want to look at the code <a href=\"https://github.com/bph/gt-podcast-bb\">it&#8217;s on GitHub</a> with some additional details. My plugin augments the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin I have been using since 2015 and makes it more blocky. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What AI adventure did you pursue this week?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how the Google Site Kit plugin is attempting to simplify their product offering, right inside of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea. Featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Mariya Moeva. Mariya has more than 15 years of experience in tech across search quality, developer advocacy, community building and outreach, and product management. Currently, she&#8217;s the product lead for Site Kit, Google&#8217;s official WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s presented at Word Camp Europe in Basel this year and joins us to talk about the journey from studying classical Japanese literature to fighting web spam at Google, and eventually shaping open source tools for the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya talks about her passion for the open web, and how years of direct feedback from site owners shaped the vision for Site Kit. Making complex analytics accessible and actionable for everyone, from solo bloggers to agencies and hosting providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Kit has had impressive growth for a WordPress plugin, currently there are 5 million active installs and a monthly user base of 700,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learn how Site Kit bundles core Google products like Search Console, Analytics, Page Speed Insights, AdSense into a simpler, curated WordPress dashboard, giving actionable insights without the need to trawl through multiple complex interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya explains how the plugin is intentionally beginner friendly with features like role-based dashboard sharing, integration with WordPress&#8217; author and category systems, and some newer additions like Reader Revenue Manager to help site owners become more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shares Google&#8217;s motivations for investing so much in WordPress and the open web, and how her team is committed to active support, trying to respond rapidly on forums and listening closely to feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed Site Kit&#8217;s roadmap, from benchmarking and reporting features, to smarter, more personalized recommendations in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt overwhelmed by analytics dashboards, or are looking for ways to make data more practical and valuable inside WordPress, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mariya Moeva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m joined on the podcast by Mariya Moeva. Hello, Mariya. Nice to meet you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Mariya is doing a presentation at WordCamp Europe. That&#8217;s where we are at the moment, and we&#8217;re going to be talking about the bits and the pieces that she does around Site Kit, the work that she does for Google. Given that you are a Googler, and that we&#8217;re going to be talking about a product that you have, will you just give us your bio? I&#8217;ve got it written here, you obviously put one on the WordCamp Europe website. But just roughly what is your place in WordPress and Google and Site Kit and all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:05] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I&#8217;ve had a very meandering path. When you would look back to what I studied, which was, you know, classical Japanese literature, all these poems about the moon and the cherry blossoms, who would&#8217;ve thought at that time that I would end up building open source plugins? But I did have a meandering path and I ended up here because, mostly because of passion for the open web, and for all kinds of weird websites that exist out there. I really love stumbling upon something great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started Google on the web spam team, actually looking into the Japanese spam market, because of this classical Japanese literature degree and the Japanese skills. And then after a couple years or so, I basically despaired of humanity because all you look at is spam every day. Bad sites, hacked sites, malicious pages. And I just wanted to do something that makes the web better rather than removing all the bad stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I switched over to an advocacy role, and in that role I essentially was traveling, maybe attending 20, 30 conferences every year, talking to a lot of people about their needs, what they have to complain about Google, what requests they have. And I would collect all of this feedback, and then I would go back to the product teams and I would say, hey, this and this is something that people really want. And they would say, thank you for your feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially at one point I said, okay, we&#8217;re going to build this thing, and that&#8217;s why I switched into product role. And I was able to take all the feedback over the years, that we&#8217;ve gotten from developers and site owners, and to try to build something that makes sense for them. So that&#8217;s how I ended up in the product role for building Site Kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea from the very beginning was to make it beginner friendly and to make it from their perspective to match that feedback, rather than doing something that is like, here&#8217;s your stuff from analytics, here&#8217;s your stuff from Search Console, figure it out. That&#8217;s how we ended up building this and it&#8217;s been now five years. And it actually just a month ago entered the top 10 plugins. So clearly people find some value in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have 700,000 people that use it every month. And overall it&#8217;s currently at 5 million active installs, meaning that these sites are kind of pinging WordPress so they&#8217;re alive and kicking. It&#8217;s been very encouraging to see that what we&#8217;re doing is helpful to people and we will keep going. There&#8217;s a lot to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s kind of amazing because in the WordPress space, there are some of the, let&#8217;s call them the heavy hitters. You know, the big plugins that we&#8217;ve all heard of, the Yoasts of this world that kind of thing. Jetpack, all those kind of things. This, honestly has gone under the radar a bit for me, and yet those numbers are truly huge. Four and a half to 5 million people over a span of five years is really rather incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> It grew very fast, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And yet it&#8217;s not one that, well, I guess most people are reaching out to plugins to solve a problem, often a business problem. So, you know, there&#8217;s this idea of, I install this and there&#8217;s an ROI on that. This is not really that, not really ROI, it&#8217;s more site improvement. Okay, here&#8217;s a site that needs things fixing on it. Here&#8217;s some data about what can be fixed. And so maybe for that reason and that reason alone, it&#8217;s flown under the radar for me because it doesn&#8217;t have that commercial component to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:24] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, for sure. It&#8217;s for free and it&#8217;s not something that, yeah, sells features or has like a premium model and we don&#8217;t market it so much. But I run a little survey in the product where people tell us where they heard from it, and a lot of the responses are either YouTube video, or like blog posts or word of mouth. So it seems to be spreading more that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, no kidding. I&#8217;ll just say the URL out loud in case you&#8217;re at a computer when you&#8217;re listening to this. It&#8217;s SiteKit, as one word, dot withgoogle.com. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the canonical URL, but that&#8217;s where I ended up when I did a quick search for it. So sitekit.withgoogle.com. And over there you&#8217;ll be able to download well, as it labels itself, Google&#8217;s official WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing that surprises me is, a, Google&#8217;s interest in WordPress. That is fascinating to me. I mean, obviously we all know, Google is this giant, this leviathan. Maybe you&#8217;ve got interest in other CMSs, maybe not. I don&#8217;t really know. But I think that&#8217;s curious. But obviously 43% of the web, kind of makes sense to partner with WordPress, doesn&#8217;t it? To improve websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:31] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. I work with plenty of CMSs. I work with Wix, with Squarespace, and we essentially what I try to do and what my team tries to do, we are called the Ecosystem Team. So we want to bring the things that we think would be useful to site owners and businesses directly to where they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are in your Wix dashboard, you should be able to see the things from Google that are useful. And same if you are in WordPress. And obviously WordPress is, orders of magnitude, a bigger footprint than any of the others. And also it has this special structure where everything is decentralised and people kind of mix and match. So that&#8217;s why we went with the plugin model. And using the public APIs, we want to show what&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because all the data that we use is public data. There&#8217;s no special Google feature that only the Google product gets, right? We are just combining it in interesting ways because I&#8217;ve spent so much time talking to people, like what they need. And so we just curate and combine in ways that are actually helping people to make decisions and to kind of clear the clutter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you go to analytics, it&#8217;s like 50 reports and so many menus and it&#8217;s like, where do I start? So we try to give a starting point in Site Kit. And we also try to help with other things like make people sustainable. One thing that we recently launched just a month ago is called Reader Revenue Manager. So you can put a little prompt on your site, which asks people to give you like $2 or whatever currency you are in, or even put like a subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the idea is you don&#8217;t have to have massive traffic in order to generate revenue from your content. If you have your hundred thousand loyal readers, they can help you be more sustainable. So we&#8217;re looking at these kind of features, like what can we launch that is more for small and medium sites and would be helpful? And how can we make it as simple as possible? So that people don&#8217;t kind of drop off during the setup because it&#8217;s too complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would it be fair to summarise the plugin&#8217;s initial purpose as kind of binding a bunch of Google products, which otherwise you would have to go and navigate to elsewhere? So for example, I&#8217;m looking at the website now, Search Console, Analytics, Page Speed Insights, AdSense, Google Ads, and all of those kind of things. Typically we&#8217;d have to go and, you know, set up an account. I guess we&#8217;d have to do that with Site Kit anyway. But we&#8217;d have to go to the different URLs and do all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intention of this then is to bind that inside of the WordPress UI, so it&#8217;s not just the person who&#8217;s the admin of that account. You can open it up so that people who have the right permissions inside of WordPress, they can see, for example, Google Analytics data. And it gets presented on the backend of WordPress rather than having to go to these other URLs. Is that how it all began as a way of sort of surfacing Google product data inside the UI of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:21] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, we wanted to bring the most important things directly to where people are, so they don&#8217;t have to bother going to 15 places. And we wanted to drastically decrease and curate the information so that it&#8217;s easy to understand, because when you have 15 dashboards in Analytics and 15 dashboards in Search Console, and then you have to figure out what to download and in which spreadsheet to merge and how to compare, then this is. Maybe if you have an agency taken care of, they can help you. But if you don&#8217;t, which 70% of our users say that they&#8217;re one person operation, so they&#8217;re taking care of their business, and on top of that, the website. We wanted to make it simpler to understand how you&#8217;re doing, and what you should do next with Google data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s a curated interface. So it&#8217;s not, I mean, maybe you can pull in every single thing if you so wish. But the idea is you give a, I don&#8217;t know, an easier to understand interface to, for example, Google Analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was always the thing for me in Google Analytics. I&#8217;m sure that if you have the time and the expertise, like you&#8217;re an agency that deals with all of that, then all of that data is probably useful and credible. But for me, I just want to know some top level items. I don&#8217;t need to dig into the weeds of everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was menus within menus, within menus, and I would get lost very quickly, and dispirited and essentially give up. So I guess this is an endeavor to get you what you need quickly inside the WordPress admin, so you don&#8217;t have to be an expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:43] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. And then it gets more powerful when you are able to combine data from different products. So, for example, we have a feature called Search Funnel in the dashboard, which lets you, it combines data from Search Console on search impressions and search clicks, and then it combines data from Analytics on visitors on the site and conversions. So it kind of helps you map out the entire path, versus having to go over here, having to go over there, having to combine everything yourself. So when you combine things, then it gets also more powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have another feature which lets you combine data from AdSense and Analytics. So if you have AdSense on your site, you can then see which pages earn you the most revenue. So when you have that, suddenly you can see, okay, so I have now these pages here, what queries are they ranking for? How much time people spend on them? Can I expand my content in that direction? It helps you to be more focused in kind of the strategy that you have for your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it just making, I mean, I say just, is it making API calls backwards and forwards to Google&#8217;s Analytics, Search Console, whatever, and then displaying that information, or is it kind of keeping it inside the WordPress database?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> We don&#8217;t store anything, well, almost anything. Yeah, we wanted to keep the data as secure as possible, so we created this proxy service, which kind of helps to exchange the credentials. So the person can authenticate with their Google account, and then from there, the data is pulled via API, and we cache the dashboard for one hour. After that we refreshed authentication token. From the data itself, nothing is stored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s just authentication information really that&#8217;s stored. Well, that&#8217;s kind of a given, I suppose. Otherwise you&#8217;ll be logging in every two minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Right. So that&#8217;s the model that we have because we really wanted people to be able to access this data, but also to keep it secure. And because of how the WordPress database is, we didn&#8217;t feel like we could save it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds from what you&#8217;ve just said, it&#8217;s as if it&#8217;s combining things from a variety of different services, kind of linking them up in a structured way so that somebody who&#8217;s not particularly experienced can make connections between, I don&#8217;t know, ads and analytics. The spend on the ads and the analytics, you know, the ROI if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it do things uniquely? Is there something you can get inside of Site Kit which you could not get out of the individual products if you went there? Or is it just more of a, well, we&#8217;ve done the hard work for you, we&#8217;ve mapped these things together so you don&#8217;t have to think about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:10] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> The one thing that it does that I&#8217;m super excited about, and we&#8217;ll build on that, but we have the fundamental of it now, is it actually creates data for you. Because in contrast to Search Console or Analytics or all these other, which are kind of Google hosted, they can only tell you like a long help center article, go there on your site, then click this, then paste this code, right? They cannot help you with this, whereas Site Kit is on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you agree, which we don&#8217;t install anything without people&#8217;s consent, like they have to activate the feature, but if you agree, then we can do things on your behalf. So for example, we can track every time someone clicks the signup button and we can generate an analytics event for you, even if that plugin normally doesn&#8217;t send analytics events. And that way, suddenly you have your conversion data available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So very often people look to the top of the funnel, like how many people came to my site? But they don&#8217;t look to what these people did beyond kind of, oh, they stayed two minutes. So what does this mean? You want to see, did they buy the thing? Did they sign up for the thing, or subscribe or whatever it is? And we help create this data because we have this unique access to the source code of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we create, for example, on leads generation or purchases. We also, every time that a specific page is viewed, we will generate an event about the author of the page. So then we can aggregate the data, which authors bring in the most page views. Let&#8217;s say you have like a site with five, six, whatever authors. Or which categories are bringing in the most engagement and these kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it really does get very WordPressy. It&#8217;s not just to do with the Google side of things. It is mapping information from Google, so categories, author profiles, that kind of thing, and mapping them into the analytics that you get. Okay, that&#8217;s interesting. So it&#8217;s a two-way process, not just a one-way process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:09] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s very much integrated with WordPress. We have also a lot of other features, like for example, that kind of stretch into other parts of the website. So this Reader Revenue Manager that I mentioned before with the prompts that you can put on your pages. You can go to the individual post and for every post there&#8217;s like a little piece of control UI that we&#8217;ve added there in the compose screen, where you can say, this is excluded from this prompt, or, you know, you can control from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we try to integrate where it makes sense, like where the person would want to take this action. And again, because it&#8217;s on the website, we can kind of spread out beyond just this one dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And would I, as a site admin, would I be able to assign permissions to different user roles within WordPress? So for example, an editor, or a certain user profile, may be able to see a subset of data. You know, for example, I don&#8217;t know, you are involved in the spending on AdSense. But you, other user over there, you&#8217;ve got nothing to do with that. But you are into the analytics, so you can see that, and you over there you can see that. Is that possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> We have something called dashboard sharing. So it has the same, like if you use Google Docs or anything like that, it has this little person with a plus in the corner, icon. And then from there, if you are the admin who set up this particular Google Service, who connected it to Site Kit, then you&#8217;re able to say who should be able to see it. So you essentially grant view only access to, let&#8217;s say all the editors, or all the contributors or whatever. And then you can choose which Google service&#8217;s data they can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So yes is the answer to that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:46] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So they don&#8217;t have to set it up, I mean, they have to go through a very simplified setup, and then they basically get a kind of a screenshot. I mean it&#8217;s, you can still click on things, but you can&#8217;t change anything, so it&#8217;s kind of a view-only dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m kind of curious about the market that you pitch this to. So sell is the wrong word because it&#8217;s a free plugin, but who you&#8217;re pitching it at. So obviously if you&#8217;ve got that end user, the site owner. Maybe they&#8217;ve got a site and they&#8217;ve got a small business with a team. Maybe it&#8217;s just them, so there&#8217;s the whole permissions thing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also I know that Google, there are whole agencies out there who just specialise in Google products, and analysing the data that comes out of Analytics. Can you do that as well as an agency? Could I set this up for my clients and have some, you know, I&#8217;ve got my agency dashboard and I want to give this client access to this website, and this website and this website, but not these other ones? Can it be deployed on a sort of agency basis like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> You would still have to activate it for every individual site. So in that sense, there&#8217;s a bunch of steps that you have to go through. But once it&#8217;s activated, you can then share with any kind of client. And actually we have a lot of agencies that can install it for every site that they have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just today someone came and after he saw the demo, he was like, okay, I&#8217;m going to install it for all my clients. Because what we&#8217;ve heard is that it&#8217;s exactly the level of information that a client would benefit from. And this means then that they pester the agency less. So we&#8217;ve literally heard people saying, you&#8217;re saving me a lot of phone calls. So that&#8217;s why agencies really like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the next big feature request, which we&#8217;re working on right now, is to generate like an email report out of that. So for those who don&#8217;t even want to log into WordPress to see, there will be a possibility to get this in their inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you could get it like a weekly summary, whatever it that wish to trigger. And, okay, so that could go anywhere really. And then your clients don&#8217;t even need to phone you about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:41] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. So we are trying to really actively reach people where they are, even if that&#8217;s their email inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And the other question I have is around your relationship with some of the bigger players, maybe hosting companies. Do you have this pre-installed on hosting cPanels and their, you know, whatever it is that they&#8217;ve got in their back end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:02] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, we have quite a few hosting providers that pre-install it for their WordPress customers. The reason for this is that they see better lifetime value for those customers that have a good idea of how their site is doing. And yeah, Hostinger is one of those. cPanel. Elementor pre-installs it for all of their users. And they see very good feedback because again, it&#8217;s super simple to set up and super easy to understand once you have it. So for them it&#8217;s kind of like an extra feature that they can offer, extra value to their users for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We know Google&#8217;s a fabulous company, but you don&#8217;t do things for nothing. So what&#8217;s the return? How does it work in reverse? So we know that presumably there must be an exchange of data. What are we signing up for if we install Site Kit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> So, at least, I mean, Google is a huge company, right? There&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of people working. So I can&#8217;t speak for the whole of Google, but I can speak for the Ecosystem Team, which I&#8217;m part of, like the web ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main investment here, or the main goal for us is that the open web continues to thrive, because if people don&#8217;t put content, interesting, relevant content on the open web, the search results are going to be very poor and that&#8217;s not a good product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our idea is to support all the people who create content to make sure that they&#8217;re found, like if you&#8217;re a local business, that people can find you when they need stuff from that particular local business. And what we see is that, especially for smaller and medium sites, they really struggle, first with going online, and then with figuring out what they&#8217;re supposed to do. And so a lot of them give up because in comparison to other platforms, it&#8217;s a little bit of an upfront investment, right? Like you have to pay for hosting, you have to set up the site, you have to add content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we try to help people as much as we can to see the value that the open web brings to them, so that they can continue to create for the open web. So that&#8217;s our hidden motivation. I think in that sense, we&#8217;re very much aligned with the WordPress community because here everybody cares about the open web and for all kind of small, weird websites to continue flourishing and get their like 100 or 300 or 1,000 readers that they deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the motivation. I think because it includes other things like AdSense and AdWords, like people can set up a ads campaign directly from Site Kit in a very simplified flow, and the same thing for AdSense. Obviously some money exchanges hands, but this is relatively minor compared to the benefit that we think there is for the web in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Google really does seem to have a very large presence at WordPress events. I mean, I don&#8217;t know about the smaller ones, you know, the regional sort of city based events, but at the, what they call flagship events, so WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe and US, there&#8217;s the whole sponsor area. And it&#8217;s usual to see one of the larger booths being occupied by Google. And I wonder, is it Site Kit that you are talking about when you are here or is it other things as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also it&#8217;s curious to me that Google would be here in that presence, because those things are not cheap to maintain. So there must be somebody up in Google somewhere saying, okay, this is something we want to invest in. So is it Site Kit that you are basically at the booth talking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:19] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> So me, yes, or people on my team. We have like a Site Kit section this year. There&#8217;s also Google Trends. There&#8217;s also some other people talking about user experience and on search. And this changes depending on which teams within Google want to reach out to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Site Kit, we&#8217;ve been pretty consistent for the last six years. We are always part of the booth. But the kind of whole team, like the whole Google booth content has kind of changed over the years as well depending on who&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I know that a lot of work being done is surrounding performance and things like that, and a lot of the Google staff that are in the WordPress space seem to be focused on that kind of thing, talking about the new APIs that are shipping in the browsers and all of those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so on the face of it, a fairly straightforward product to use. But I&#8217;m guessing the devil is in the detail. How do you go about supporting this? So for example, if I was to install it and to run into some problems, do you have like a, I don&#8217;t know, a documentation area or do you have support, or chat or anything like that? Because I know that with the best will in the world, people are going to run into problems. How do people manage that kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:27] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, this was something that I was super, I felt really strongly about based on my previous experience in the developer advocate world. Because very often I got feedback that it&#8217;s super hard to reach Google. And it&#8217;s also understandable given the scale of some of the products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I started this project I insisted that we allocate resources for support. So we have two people full-time support. One of them is upstairs, the support lead. He knows the product inside and out. They&#8217;re always on the forum, the plugin forum, support forum. And they answer usually within 24 hours. So everybody who has a question gets their question answered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also created the very detailed additions. When you have Site Kit, you also get a few additions to the Site Health forum, so you can share that information with them and they see like detailed stuff about the website so they can help debug. And in many, many cases, I&#8217;ve seen people coming pretty angry, leave a one star review, then James or Adam who are support people, engage with them, and then it turns into a five star review because they feel like, okay, someone listened to me and helped me figure out what is going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have real people answering questions relatively quickly. And they don&#8217;t just go, of course they focus on the WordPress support forum, but they also check Reddit and other places where people like mentioned Site Kit, and they try to help and to direct them to the right place. So for Site Kit, we have very robust support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when it&#8217;s an issue with a product, a Google product that is connected to Site Kit, so it&#8217;s not a Site Kit problem, let&#8217;s say you got some kind of strange message from AdSense about your account status changing. Then we would have to hand over to the AdSense account manager or support team that they have, because we don&#8217;t know everything, like how AdSense makes decisions and stuff like that. But for anything Site Kit related, we are very fast to answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s good to hear because I think you&#8217;re right. I think the perception with any giant company is that it kind of becomes a bit impersonal, and Google would be no exception. And having just a forum which never seems to get an answer, you drop something in, six months later, you go back and nobody&#8217;s done anything in there except close the thread, kind of slightly annoying. But something like this. So 24 hours, roughly speaking, is the turnaround time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:45] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah. I mean, not on the weekend, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Still, that&#8217;s pretty amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:47] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, yeah. We are very serious about this because, I mean, also the WordPress community is really strong, right? So you want to show that we care. We want to hear from people. A lot of bugs then also turn into feature requests and get prioritised to be developed. So, yeah, we really value when people come to complain. It&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Excellent. Okay, well, we won&#8217;t open that as a goal, please send in your complaints. But nevertheless, it&#8217;s nice that you take it seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it sounds like it&#8217;s under active development. You sound like this is basically what you&#8217;re doing over at Google. Do you have a roadmap? Do you have a sort of laundry list of things that you want to achieve over the next six months? Interesting things that we might want to hear about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:21] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Sure, yeah. I mean, my ultimate vision, which is not the next six months, I would love to move away as much as possible from just stats. As curated and as kind of structured as it is right now, and get more into like recommendations, and like to-do list. Because what I hear from people again and again, it&#8217;s like, I have two hours this month, tell me what should I do with those two hours?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;re asking a lot from us. They&#8217;re asking essentially to look, analyse everything and to prioritise their tasks, to tell them which one is the most important or most impactful. And this is like several levels of analysis further than where we are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one thing that we are looking to work on is benchmarking, because you cannot know are you growing or not, unless you know how you&#8217;re doing on average. And today, people who are a little bit more savvy can do this of course, but a lot of people don&#8217;t. And so for us to be able to tell you, not just you got 20 clicks this week, but also this is okay for you, or this is better than last year, this time, or this is better than your competitors. I think that&#8217;s a really valuable way to interpret the data and to help people understand what it means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And really, Google is one of the only entities that can provide that kind of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:44] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Especially for search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, especially against competitors. That&#8217;s really interesting because analysing the data, whilst it&#8217;s fun for some people, I feel it&#8217;s not that interesting for most people. And so just having spreadsheets of data, charts of data, it&#8217;s interesting and you no doubt gain some important knowledge from it. But being told, here&#8217;s the outcomes of that data, try doing this thing and try doing that thing, that is much more profound than just demonstrating the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m guessing, I could be wrong about this, and I&#8217;ve more or less said this in every interview over the last year, I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s an AI component to all of that. Getting AI to sort of analyse the data and give useful feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:22] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> I mean, we are investigating how to do all of these things. I think in the case of WordPress, it&#8217;s a little bit trickier again, because of the distributed nature, and the fact that all the site information lives on the site and then all the Google information. So we&#8217;re not like fully hosted where you can access everything and control everything, something like a Squarespace or a Wix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s definitely, like AI is a perfect use case for this, right? Like benchmarking, you can bucket sites into relevant groups and then see, are they performing better or worse? That&#8217;s like classic machine learning case. And we will see exactly, technically, how we&#8217;re going to reach this, but that&#8217;s one of the things that we&#8217;re working on right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing is to expand much more the conversion reporting and to help people understand, are they achieving their goals? Because this is something that surprisingly to me, so many people pay money and invest time in the site, and they cannot articulate what the site is doing. Is it working? Is it doing its job? And they&#8217;re like, well, like I got some people visiting. And I&#8217;m like, did they buy the thing? So you have to know what to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>track, and then also to take action after you see the metrics, like to move them in one direction or another. And so helping people like map out this full funnel is one thing that we&#8217;re working on. And the other thing is also this email report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s amazing. So really under active development. And you sound very impassioned about it. You sound like this has become your mission, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:47] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> I think, nobody ever complained that something is easy, right? When you make things simple and easy for people, they appreciate, even if they&#8217;re more knowledgeable than if they can do more advanced things themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I personally really care, like every time that I find a random website with really strange content, but just, someone put their soul into it. I recently found something in Zurich of like tours of Zurich, walking tours, by someone who really cares about history and architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a terrible website design wise, but the content is amazing. And I was like, okay, this person could use some help, but he&#8217;s doing, or she&#8217;s doing like a great job at the content part, and then should get the traffic that they deserve for this. So that&#8217;s what motivates me also to come here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One person, two or three WordCamps ago came over and was saying, everything about Google is hard except Site Kit. And I was like, yeah, that&#8217;s what we are trying to do. We really want to simplify things for you. So, yeah, being here is also super motivating. To talk to people and to hear feedback and feature requests. And again, we like when people come to complain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, I was just speaking to a few people prior to you entering the room and those few people all have Site Kit installed on their site. So you&#8217;re doing something right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:02] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> I hope it&#8217;s helpful. I hope it answers some questions and saves people some time. That&#8217;s what we are trying to do. Yeah, we are in the part of Google that has the ecosystem focus, so we know that ecosystem changes take longer. I mean, still it&#8217;s a fast growing plugin. It got to 5 million in 5 years, but still that&#8217;s 5 years. And in the context of software companies which move very fast, 5 years is a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we will keep going and hopefully more people can benefit from it. But we do have, yeah, still there are many people who come by and they&#8217;re like, whoa, what is this? Show me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s nice. There&#8217;s for growth as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:38] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, yeah. For sure. I mean, for sure there&#8217;s always, and more people create new sites. So, again, going back to that hosting provider question of like, can we bring it to them at the moment of creation so that they know this is something I can use?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So one more time, the URL is sitekit.withgoogle.com. I will place that into the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya, I think that&#8217;s everything that I have to ask. Thank you so much for chatting to me about Site Kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:01] <strong>Mariya Moeva:</strong> Yeah, thank you for the invitation. It&#8217;s been a pleasure to talk about the ecosystem. And, yeah, if people have feature requests, they can always write us either on GitHub in the Site Kit repo, or on the support forum, or if they are coming to any WordCamp where we also are, we are also super happy to hear. So we always love to know what people struggle with, so that we can build it for them and make it easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much indeed.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariyamoeva/\">Mariya Moeva</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya has more than 15 years of experience in tech across search quality, developer advocacy, community building and outreach, and product management. Currently she’s the product lead for Site Kit, Google’s official WordPress plugin. She’s presented at WordCamp Europe in Basel this year, and joins us to talk about the journey from studying classical Japanese literature to fighting web spam at Google, and eventually shaping open source tools for the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya talks about her passion for the open web and how years of direct feedback from site owners shaped the vision for Site Kit, making complex analytics accessible and actionable for everyone, from solo bloggers to agencies and hosting providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Kit has had impressive growth for a WordPress plugin, currently there are 5 million active installs and a monthly user base of 700,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learn how Site Kit bundles core Google products, like Search Console, Analytics, PageSpeed Insights, AdSense into a simpler, curated WordPress dashboard, giving actionable insights without the need to trawl through multiple complex interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mariya explains how the plugin is intentionally beginner-friendly, with features like role-based dashboard sharing, integration with WordPress’ author and category systems, and some newer additions like Reader Revenue Manager to help site owners become more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shares Google’s motivations for investing so much in WordPress and the open web, and how her team is committed to active support, trying to respond rapidly on forums and listening closely to feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Site Kit’s roadmap, from benchmarking and reporting features to smarter, more personalised recommendations in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by analytics dashboards, or are looking for ways to make data more practical and valuable inside WordPress, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2

It’s a story woven with personal growth, learning, community, and quiet resilience — a journey that began in a small city in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udaipur\">Udaipur, Rajasthan, India</a>, and now reaches across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXedVMYabF4JiHteWIjqrp24wRnBnLGodWAaRQ9yY3iFP6hykY88FQ-VHse-2WX-HYOeiWzn6-J8wuulsTXfMkFFvSBW3eGXl8LyB50CEAE_aXLdQRFEwVKQ9QXh9SEFR93l9wnPFg?key=5NJTv3YzQ_HvxKfiq8hX5A\" style=\"width: 805px; height: auto;\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born and raised in Udaipur — a city known for its lakes and history, but not especially for tech companies. After completing my college degree, like many fresh graduates, I faced the uncertainty of landing a job — especially with the added constraint of staying in my hometown. Thankfully, my parents were incredibly supportive. They guided me, encouraged me, and reminded me that ambition has no boundaries — not even geographical ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-unexpected-beginning\"><strong>The Unexpected Beginning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I had trained in software testing, I didn’t know much about WordPress back then. I stumbled into the WordPress world by joining a local startup in Udaipur. That decision would change the course of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company, led by <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-my-future/\">Puneet Sahalot</a>, was where my real journey began. Puneet, a close friend and mentor, introduced me to WordPress — its structure, its vastness, and more importantly, its values. He had a gift for seeing potential in people and believed in exploring uncharted paths. Puneet is no longer with us today, but his wisdom and encouragement remain a cornerstone in my journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his influence, I began digging deeper into WordPress. Finding my first bug on the WordPress core was a moment of both confusion and pride. Submitting it felt like stepping into a world where I didn’t just work on projects — I became part of a global movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“That one bug wasn’t just a bug — it was a beginning.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That first bug ignited something within me. I started contributing to various areas — from core testing to translations, organizing local WordCamps, and even speaking at events. It felt empowering to give back to something that gave me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1987.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8096\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1987.jpg\" width=\"800\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/9c4e2977-d4b6-44b4-a5d5-87ba4ece3883.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8100\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/9c4e2977-d4b6-44b4-a5d5-87ba4ece3883.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7704fd56-150f-4ff7-a68d-c432269a8c5e.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8101\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7704fd56-150f-4ff7-a68d-c432269a8c5e-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f6e17e30-332e-4084-9a79-8b7720015785.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8102\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f6e17e30-332e-4084-9a79-8b7720015785-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9437.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8103\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9437-984x1024.jpg\" width=\"984\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-growth-beyond-comfort-zones\"><strong>Growth Beyond Comfort Zones</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marriage brought a new chapter — I moved to a metro city and joined <a href=\"https://brainstormforce.com/\">Brainstorm Force</a>, where I worked on a suite of powerful WordPress products, including the very popular Astra theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a small local team to a larger product-driven organization, the shift was both challenging and fulfilling. I moved from being a tester to becoming a Product Manager, learning to balance leadership, quality assurance, user experience, and team collaboration. I found myself not just testing products — but shaping them.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I was also incredibly grateful to have a life partner who encouraged me to aim higher and supported my ambitions every step of the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the proudest moments in my journey was being selected to lead the test team for the WordPress 5.6 and 5.7 releases. It was surreal. The appreciation and recognition I received from the global community made me realize how far I had come — from finding my first bug to helping others make WordPress better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9461.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8104\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9461-922x1024.jpg\" width=\"922\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8107\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-766x1024.jpg\" width=\"766\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8108\" height=\"189\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-1024x189.png\" width=\"1024\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-rhythm-work-and-motherhood\"><strong>A New Rhythm: Work and Motherhood</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Life shifted gears again when I joined <a href=\"https://caseproof.com/\">Caseproof</a> (<a href=\"https://memberpress.com/\">MemberPress</a>) — a fully remote role that brought with it the flexibility I needed at a very important time in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working remotely was a new experience but quickly became a blessing. When I became a mother, I embraced both worlds with open arms. I continued to work with the same dedication, sometimes holding my daughter in one arm while debugging with the other.
