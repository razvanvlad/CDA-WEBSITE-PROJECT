## 🗂️ Content Migration Strategy

### From Page Templates to Custom Post Types:

1. **Services Migration:**
   - Move content from individual service pages to Services post type
   - Assign appropriate Service Type taxonomy terms
   - Link related case studies using relationship fields

2. **Case Studies Migration:**
   - Convert individual case study pages to Case Study post type
   - Assign Project Type taxonomy terms  
   - Set featured flag for homepage display

3. **Team Migration:**
   - Convert team page content to individual Team Member posts
   - Assign Department taxonomy terms
   - Set featured flag for key team members

### File Cleanup:

**Removed Templates:**
- ❌ `template-case-study-oakleigh.php` - Replaced by Case Study post type

**Templates to Consider Removing:**
- `template-team.php` - Could be replaced by Team Members archive
- `template-service-detail.php` - Could be replaced by Services single template

**Templates Retained:**
- ✅ `template-homepage.php` - Still needed
- ✅ `template-about-us.php` - Still needed
- ✅ `template-contact.php` - Still needed
- ✅ `template-404.php` - Still needed
- ✅ `template-knowledge-hub.php` - Still needed
- ✅ `template-terms-conditions.php` - Still needed
