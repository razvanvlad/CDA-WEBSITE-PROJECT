OLD ACF FIELD GROUPS TO DELETE
==============================

These field groups are causing the duplicate/conflicting sections on the homepage.
Go to: WordPress Admin → Custom Fields → Field Groups

DELETE THESE FIELD GROUPS:
--------------------------

1. ❌ "Homepage" (or "Homepage Content" - the OLD one)
   - This contains the old individual blocks that should be global
   - Look for the one that has "Why CDA Block", "Services Accordion", etc.

2. ❌ "Global Shared Content" 
   - The old grouped global content structure
   - Should be replaced by the new individual Global Content Blocks

3. ❌ "Global Block Overrides"
   - Old override system

4. ❌ Any field group containing these individual blocks:
   - "Why CDA Block"
   - "Services Accordion" 
   - "Stats & Image"
   - "Locations with Image"
   - "Content Blocks"

KEEP THESE FIELD GROUPS:
-----------------------

✅ "Homepage Content" (the NEW clean one with unique keys)
   - Should show: Header Section, Projects Section, Case Studies Section, Global Content Selection

✅ "Global Content Blocks"
   - Should contain all 9 global blocks for content entry

HOW TO IDENTIFY THE RIGHT ONES:
-------------------------------

The CORRECT field groups have these characteristics:
- Homepage Content: Has "Global Content Selection" with 9 toggles
- Global Content Blocks: Located at "global-content-blocks" options page

The WRONG field groups have these characteristics:
- Individual "Why CDA Block", "Services Accordion" fields
- "Global Shared Content" section
- Old field keys/structure

AFTER DELETION:
--------------
The homepage should ONLY show:
- Header Section ✓
- Projects Section ✓  
- Case Studies Section ✓
- Global Content Selection (9 toggles) ✓

And NOTHING ELSE!
