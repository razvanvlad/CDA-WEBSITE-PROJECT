Success Summary
Pattern 3 (Text Only) is working! The About Us page now successfully renders content from WordPress ACF fields.
Key Findings
Root Cause: Template-based ACF location rules (page_template = template-about-us.php) don't automatically expose fields to GraphQL schema.
Solution: Added manual GraphQL type mapping by checking "Page (Post Type)" in the About Us field group settings.
Technical Issues Resolved:

Variable type mismatch: Changed $uri: String! to $uri: ID!
ACF field visibility in GraphQL schema
Query structure alignment between GraphiQL and Next.js

Next Steps
Immediate:

Test Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 to determine correct ACF image field structure
Identify which pattern works for images, then create final production query

Implementation:

Create clean About Us component without test buttons
Apply same pattern to additional pages (Services, Contact, etc.)
Use post_type = page location rules for future ACF field groups to avoid GraphQL mapping issues

Architecture:

Template-based location rules work in WordPress admin but fail in GraphQL
Manual type mapping or post-type rules ensure GraphQL compatibility
Pattern established for scaling to multiple pages

The foundation is solid. Test image patterns next, then build remaining pages using this proven approach.
