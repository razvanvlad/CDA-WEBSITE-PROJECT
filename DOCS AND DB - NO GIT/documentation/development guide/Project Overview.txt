CDA Website Project: Technical Implementation Summary
Project Overview
We have successfully established a headless WordPress architecture using Next.js as the frontend and WordPress with WPGraphQL as the backend. 
Our project follows a structured approach to content management, with a focus on clean architecture, proper data fetching, and scalable component design.

Key Files and Their Purpose
1. cda-cms.php - The core WordPress plugin that:

Enables ACF GraphQL functionality
Removes Gutenberg editor to maintain consistency
Creates custom post types and taxonomies
Configures ACF field groups for Homepage and About Us pages
Sets up global content options
2. client.js - Apollo Client configuration that:

Connects to our WordPress GraphQL endpoint
Handles authentication and headers
Provides a centralized GraphQL client for data fetching
3. queries.js - Contains all GraphQL queries with:

GET_HOMEPAGE_CONTENT - Fetches all homepage data
GET_ABOUT_US_CONTENT - Fetches about us page data
Properly structured queries with inline fragments for union types
GraphQL Integration
Packages Installed
WPGraphQL: The core GraphQL plugin for WordPress
WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields: Enables ACF fields in GraphQL
@apollo/client: For GraphQL queries in Next.js
graphql: GraphQL language utilities
Implementation Approach
We implemented a headless architecture where:

WordPress serves as a content management system
WPGraphQL exposes content through a GraphQL API
Next.js fetches data via GraphQL queries
React components render the content

The query uses inline fragments (... on) to access fields from different GraphQL interfaces:

NodeWithTitle for the page title
NodeWithFeaturedImage for featured images
Page for the ACF field group homepageContent
Challenges and Solutions
1. ACF Field Visibility in GraphQL

Issue: ACF fields were not appearing in the GraphQL schema
Solution: Added show_in_graphql flag to ACF field groups and ensured graphql_field_name was properly set
2. Field Naming Conventions

Issue: Field name mismatches between ACF configuration and GraphQL schema
Solution: Used camelCase for field names in queries to match GraphQL's naming convention
3. Authentication Errors

Issue: "Cookie nonce is invalid" errors during GraphQL queries
Solution: Configured Apollo Client with proper headers and authentication handling
4. Fragment Type Mismatch

Issue: "Fragment cannot be spread here" errors
Solution: Properly used inline fragments for union types and interface implementations
5. Image Field Structure

Issue: Complex image field structure with nested objects
Solution: Navigated the proper path: featuredImage { node { sourceUrl altText } }
Current Functionality
Our implementation successfully:

Connects Next.js frontend to WordPress backend via GraphQL
Fetches structured content from ACF field groups
Renders homepage content with all sections
Handles different field types (text, images, repeaters, etc.)
Implements proper error handling and loading states

Next Steps
Implement the About Us page with the same pattern
Create additional page templates
Implement global components (header, footer)
Add SEO optimization with schema markup
Implement responsive design across all breakpoints
This architecture provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable headless WordPress site with clean separation between content management and presentation layers.
