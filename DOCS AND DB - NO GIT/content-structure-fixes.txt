CONTENT STRUCTURE FIXING STRATEGIES
=====================================

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
- Current setup groups multiple blocks under "Global Shared Content"
- No way to select individual blocks independently
- Forces all-or-nothing approach when using shared content
- Lack of granular control over content display

SOLUTION STRATEGIES:

1. INDIVIDUAL BLOCK SELECTION APPROACH
--------------------------------------
Instead of grouping blocks, make each block individually selectable:

Current Structure:
- Global Shared Content (group)
  ├── Why CDA Block
  ├── Approach Block
  ├── Values Block
  ├── Technologies Showcase Block
  ├── Showreel Block
  ├── Newsletter Signup Block
  ├── Ready To Start CTA Block
  └── Photo Frame Block

Improved Structure:
- Individual Global Blocks
  ├── □ Why CDA Block
  ├── □ Approach Block
  ├── □ Values Block
  ├── □ Technologies Showcase Block
  ├── □ Showreel Block
  ├── □ Newsletter Signup Block
  ├── □ Ready To Start CTA Block
  └── □ Photo Frame Block

Benefits:
- Each block can be toggled independently
- Granular control over content
- No forced groupings
- Flexible page composition

2. HIERARCHICAL SELECTION WITH OVERRIDES
-----------------------------------------
Keep groups but add individual control:

Structure:
- Page-Specific Content
  ├── Locations with image
  ├── Services Accordion
  └── Stats & Image

- Global Content Selection
  ├── □ Enable All Global Blocks
  ├── Individual Block Controls:
      ├── □ Why CDA Block
      ├── □ Approach Block
      ├── □ Values Block
      ├── □ Technologies Showcase Block
      ├── □ Showreel Block
      ├── □ Newsletter Signup Block
      ├── □ Ready To Start CTA Block
      └── □ Photo Frame Block

- Global Block Overrides
  ├── Why CDA Override
  └── Approach Override

Benefits:
- Backward compatibility
- Quick "select all" option
- Individual control when needed
- Override capability maintained

3. CONTENT LIBRARY APPROACH
---------------------------
Treat blocks as library components that can be selected:

Structure:
- Page Content Sections
  ├── Page-Specific Sections
      ├── Locations with image
      ├── Services Accordion
      └── Stats & Image
  
  ├── Available Global Sections
      ├── + Add Why CDA Block
      ├── + Add Approach Block
      ├── + Add Values Block
      ├── + Add Technologies Showcase Block
      ├── + Add Showreel Block
      ├── + Add Newsletter Signup Block
      ├── + Add Ready To Start CTA Block
      └── + Add Photo Frame Block

- Selected Global Sections
  └── [Drag and drop selected sections here]

Benefits:
- Visual selection process
- Drag-and-drop ordering
- Clear separation of available vs. selected
- Intuitive user experience

4. CATEGORY-BASED WITH SELECTIVE ENABLE
---------------------------------------
Group by purpose but allow individual selection:

Structure:
- Content Categories
  
  ├── Marketing Blocks
      ├── □ Why CDA Block
      ├── □ Values Block
      └── □ Ready To Start CTA Block
  
  ├── Interactive Blocks
      ├── □ Technologies Showcase Block
      ├── □ Showreel Block
      └── □ Newsletter Signup Block
  
  ├── Information Blocks
      ├── □ Approach Block
      └── □ Photo Frame Block
  
  └── Page-Specific Blocks
      ├── □ Locations with image
      ├── □ Services Accordion
      └── □ Stats & Image

Benefits:
- Logical grouping by function
- Individual control within categories
- Better organization
- Scalable structure

5. PRESET COMBINATIONS WITH CUSTOM OPTION
-----------------------------------------
Provide common combinations plus custom selection:

Structure:
- Content Presets
  ├── ○ Full Global Content (all blocks)
  ├── ○ Marketing Focus (Why CDA, Values, CTA)
  ├── ○ Interactive Only (Tech Showcase, Showreel, Newsletter)
  ├── ○ Minimal (Newsletter Signup only)
  └── ○ Custom Selection

- Custom Selection (when selected)
  ├── □ Why CDA Block
  ├── □ Approach Block
  ├── □ Values Block
  ├── □ Technologies Showcase Block
  ├── □ Showreel Block
  ├── □ Newsletter Signup Block
  ├── □ Ready To Start CTA Block
  └── □ Photo Frame Block

Benefits:
- Quick common configurations
- Custom flexibility when needed
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Maintains power user options

IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

IMMEDIATE FIX (Strategy #1):
1. Convert "Global Shared Content" group to individual checkboxes
2. Each block becomes independently selectable
3. Remove the grouping constraint
4. Update the admin interface to show individual toggles

LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT (Strategy #3):
1. Implement drag-and-drop content builder
2. Create content library interface
3. Add section ordering capabilities
4. Include preview functionality

DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED:
- Instead of storing one "global_content_enabled" flag
- Store individual flags: "newsletter_enabled", "why_cda_enabled", etc.
- Or use a JSON field to store selected block IDs
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration

USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add block descriptions/previews
- Show which blocks are currently active
- Provide ordering controls
- Include enable/disable all toggle
- Add search/filter for large block libraries

TESTING SCENARIOS:
1. Select only Newsletter Signup Block → Should work
2. Select multiple individual blocks → Should display correctly
3. Override specific blocks → Should maintain functionality
4. Migration from current setup → Should preserve existing configurations
5. Different page types → Should support varying block combinations
