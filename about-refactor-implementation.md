# About Page Refactor Implementation

This document summarizes the refactor of the About page (src/app/about/page.js) to a server component and how global content blocks are fetched and rendered.

Goals
- Move data fetching from the client into the server component
- Reuse global content fetch (getGlobalContent) and keep section toggles working
- Remove duplication and improve stability (avoid client-side flicker and runtime errors)

Summary of Changes
1) Converted About to a server page
- The page is now an async server component and exports `revalidate = 300` for ISR.
- All fetching happens on the server.

2) Global content
- Uses `getGlobalContent()` to fetch reusable global blocks: approach, values, whyCda, cultureGallerySlider, contact blocks, and `statsAndNumbers`.
- Keeps About’s own toggles (aboutUsContent.globalContentSelection) to decide which blocks render.

3) About content fetch
- Fetches `aboutUsContent` via a server GraphQL query.
- `contentPageHeader` (title, text, image, cta) is rendered at the top of the page when present.

4) Technologies slider normalization
- Normalizes logos in `technologiesSlider` (from nodes/edges to a plain array with url/alt/title) for consistent rendering in the client component.

5) Culture Gallery Slider hardening
- The client CultureGallerySlider component is defensive and now handles images provided as `nodes`, `edges`, or a plain array.

Key Files
- src/app/about/page.js (server page)
- src/components/globalblocks/culturegalleryslider.jsx (defensive image normalization)

Why this approach
- Simplifies the About page: server handles data, client components handle interactivity only when needed.
- Reduces client-side API round-trips and improves reliability.

Follow-ups
- Optionally append GlobalTailSections at the end of the About page for strict consistency with other pages (Case Studies, Stats & Numbers, Approach). Currently, the About page renders blocks individually based on About’s toggles to preserve layout order.
